    <td width="100%"> <p align="justify" style="text-align:justify">An article 
        on &#8216;Fundamentalist Economy in Bangladesh&#8217; by Dr. Abul Barakat, 
        Professor of Economics, Dhaka University, appeared in The Daily Inqilab 
        on 27 April 2005. On reading the summary of the article, I became interested 
        in reading the full text. Thanks to Dr. Nazmul Huq Rabi, Managing Director 
        of Institute for Development and Research, for providing me with the full 
        text of the article. </p>
      <p align="justify">We are used to regard a teacher of a university with 
        great respect. We would like to look upon a university teacher in the 
        same way even in future. But when an &#8216;eminent&#8217; teacher assumes 
        the role of a propagandist rather than taking a neutral and impartial 
        approach in a discourse, it naturally raises a lot of questions. The key 
        condition for presenting something in a fair way is to have an objective 
        approach. However Prof. Dr. Abul Barakat in his article &#8216;Fundamentalist 
        Economy in Bangladesh&#8217;, I am sorry to say, could not maintain that 
        and I shall make an attempt to prove that in my discussion.</p>
      <p align="justify">Dr. Abul Barakat, in his article, has mixed up and amalgamated 
        the basic difference between Islamic way of life and worldly materialism. 
        He wrote: &#8220;They (the fundamentalists) have invested in the short 
        and long term projects from which it is possible to earn large profits. 
        That means, though they are showing their keen interest in the Hereafter, 
        they are more conscious about worldly life than many others&#8221;. [Prof. 
        Dr. Abul Barakat, Bangladeshe Maulobader Orthoniti (Fundamentalist Economy 
        in Bangladesh), Samaj Orthoniti O Rastro, Mukti Bhavan, 22/1 Purana Paltan, 
        Dhaka 1000, April 2005, pp 19-20]. </p>
      <p align="justify">Without questioning the authenticity of this statement, 
        I would like to say that if Dr. Abul Barakat had clear knowledge about 
        the teachings of Islam and its lifestyle, he would have hesitated to make 
        such a comment. </p>
      <p align="justify">Everyday we say in our prayer: Rabbana Atina Fiddunia 
        Hasanataw Wafil Akhirati Hasanataw- Our Lord! Give us good in this world 
        and good in the Hereafter [2 (Surat Al Baqarah):201]. In Islamic beliefs, 
        the Hereafter is not insignificant rather worldly life of a Muslim is 
        the way for success in the Hereafter. </p>
      <p align="justify">Thanks to Dr. Abul Barakat for analyzing the economic 
        condition in the post-independence Bangladesh, especially for his comment 
        &#8216;the gap between the promise [by the progressive leaders] and the 
        reality&#8217; [p 9]. During that period poverty has increased. In his 
        words: &#8220;During the last 33 years some people have become owners 
        of huge wealth and resources while a large section has become pauper; 
        resources were not mobilized for productive purposes, unearned income 
        looked for more sources of unearned income; lives of some have enhanced 
        in elegance while the difficulties and deprivations of various kinds of 
        the vast majority have increased; high-rise buildings have been built, 
        while the number of slums have increased. Real government spending in 
        public welfare has decreased, while it has increased in unproductive sectors; 
        foreign interference has increased, but local and indigenous initiative 
        has decreased; government expenditure in unproductive sectors has increased, 
        at the same time has increased the distance between the public and the 
        public servants; election expenditure has increased, but good governance 
        and effectiveness of the elected institutions have decreased; the power 
        of black money has increased, while the compassion of the politicians 
        towards the people has decreased. Disparity between the rich and the poor 
        in education has increased, but the actual government funding in the basic 
        education sector has decreased; poverty related diseases have increased, 
        so is the cost of healthcare, but the competence of the public health 
        sector has decreased&#8221; [p 12]. </p>
      <p align="justify">&#8220;This trend of development during the last 33 years 
        has clearly divided our country of 14 crore into two groups: In the first 
        group are the powerful minority whose number is maximum 10 lakh &#8230; 
        a situation where as against 10 lakh powerful are 13 crore and 90 lakh 
        powerless, helpless, disadvantaged and deprived people&#8221; [p 10]. 
        For this situation the writer has accused &#8220;a self-destructive plundering 
        culture that has invaded all sectors, including economy, politics, education 
        and culture&#8221; [p 10]. In his own words: &#8220;The characteristics 
        of this plundering culture are black money, terrorism, illegal weapon, 
        muscle power, bribery corruption, maladministration, oppression and repression 
        etc.&#8221; [p10]. </p>
      <p align="justify">Dr. Abul Barakat rightfully pointed out: &#8220;In the 
        post-independence Bangladesh welfare oriented politics did not flourish 
        as expected&#8221; [p 13]. Naturally the question arises: who were inseparably 
        linked and associated with this plundering culture? For whom the progress 
        of welfare-oriented pro-people politics did not get momentum, necessary 
        impetus and vigor? Who were at power during that period? During that period 
        the people who were at power were the advocates of secular, left and so-called 
        progressive ideas. </p>
      <p align="justify">Coming to the discussion on fundamentalism, Dr. Abul 
        Barakat mentioned eight business and financial sectors and said that fundamentalist 
        political parties are being financed from the income of the establishments 
        of these eight sectors. In his words: &#8220;Part of the profit goes to 
        organizational activities&#8221; [p 17]. More so, he said: &#8220;Many 
        a people think that armed terrorist religious communal forces of the country 
        get all the money to run the organization from outside the country&#8221; 
        [p 17]. &#8220;They got huge amount of foreign money in the 70s and 80s&#8221; 
        [p 17], Dr. Abul Barakat said though he did not provide any proof or evidence 
        to support his claim. How far academic is such generalized and sweeping 
        comment is a big question. </p>
      <p align="justify">Dr. Abul Barakat has presented a balance sheet of the 
        fundamentalists&#8217; economic activities in Bangladesh. In his opinion: 
        &#8220;Now the net profit from fundamentalist economy in Bangladesh is 
        approximately Taka 1200 crore&#8221; [p 17]. He has given a breakup of 
        Taka 1200 crore: 27 percent from financial institutions like banks, insurance 
        companies and leasing companies, 20.8 percent from non-government organizations, 
        10.8 percent from commercial organizations, 10.4 percent from healthcare 
        including pharmaceutical industries and diagnostic centers, 9.2 percent 
        from educational institutions, 8.3 percent from real estate business, 
        7.5 percent from transport business and 5.8 percent from news media and 
        information technology [pp 17-18]. The percentage of net profit, in his 
        words, &#8216;pattern&#8217; is based on &#8216;assumption&#8217; [p 18]. 
      </p>
      <p align="justify">The information and the statistics provided by Dr. Abul 
        Barakat do not in any way represent the true picture rather these are 
        utterly imaginary. In order to prove the futility of his claims we shall 
        analyze a few of his claims. He claimed that Islamic banks, Islamic insurance 
        companies and Islamic leasing companies make net profit of Taka 325 crore 
        (27 percent of Taka 1200 crore) [p 18]. His claim is not at all true. 
        Let us examine the matter in depth. At present there are six Islamic banks, 
        five Islamic insurance companies and one Islamic leasing company in Bangladesh 
        of which the sponsors and directors of one Islamic bank come from progressive 
        and secular background. None of its sponsors and directors is fundamentalists 
        rather they are known in the society for their opposition to fundamentalism.</p>
      <p align="justify">Of the five Islamic insurance companies, only one as 
        a successful business establishment has issued public shares. In 2004 
        this insurance company after deducting Taka 15 crore 76 lakh as tax and 
        appropriation has distributed profit of Taka 90 lakh among the shareholders. 
        In 2004 the net profit earned by the other four Islamic insurance companies, 
        after keeping reserve of Taka 2 crore 64 lakh as appropriation, did not 
        have taxable income or sufficient profit to distribute among shareholders. 
      </p>
      <p align="justify">The only leasing company as a successful business establishment 
        till now did not issue public shares. This leasing company after deducting 
        Taka 1 crore 26 lakh as tax and appropriation made profit of 1 crore 47 
        lakh. The leasing company, however, made provision to issue bonus shares 
        equal to the amount of profit. It means the shareholders of this Islamic 
        leasing company did not get any profit in cash in 2004. </p>
      <p align="justify">Of the six Islamic banks, if we leave the Islamic bank 
        whose sponsors and directors come from progressive and secular background 
        and are known in the society for their opposition to fundamentalism, we 
        have five Islamic banks. In 2003 these five Islamic banks after deducting 
        Taka 119 crore 50 lakh as income tax and appropriation distributed Taka 
        70 crore 45 lakh as profit among the shareholders. In the same period 
        one Islamic bank made a net loss of Taka 39 crore. It may be mentioned 
        here that the first Islamic bank that was established in Bangladesh in 
        1983 and which now has 151 branches, its 58 percent ownership is held 
        by foreign nationals and organizations notable of which is the Jeddah-based 
        Islamic Development Bank (IDB). </p>
      <p align="justify">So where do we stand? Islamic insurance companies made 
        a profit of Taka 90 lac. Islamic banks made a profit of Taka 70 crore 
        45 lakh that was distributed to the shareholders. The lone Islamic leasing 
        company made a profit of Taka 1 crore 47 lakh. The leasing company, however, 
        made provision to issue bonus shares equal to the amount of profit. That 
        means Islamic banks, Islamic insurance companies and the lone Islamic 
        leasing company&#8217;s net income, after deducting the amount paid to 
        the government as income tax and other appropriations, is Taka 72 crore 
        82 lakh which the shareholders received. Yet Dr. Abul Barakat in his article 
        has claimed that Islamic banks, Islamic insurance companies and the lone 
        Islamic leasing company made net income of Taka 325 crore. In his words, 
        this is the net income of the fundamentalist financial institutions. </p>
      <p align="justify">Now the question is whether there is any scope for the 
        financial institutions to transfer any money to any political party for 
        carrying out its political activities? Dr. Abul Barakat is definitely 
        aware that these financial institutions have been established under the 
        statutory rules as in case of banks under the Bank Company Act 1991. All 
        banks are to operate under the supervision of Bangladesh Bank, the country&#8217;s 
        central bank, and financial institutions whose shares are transacted in 
        the share market and available for buying and selling, they must follow 
        the rules and regulations of the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission, 
        besides they have to follow the rules and regulations of Dhaka Stock Exchange 
        and Chittagong Stock Exchange. The accounts of the financial institutions 
        are approved by the annual general meetings, besides profits and appropriations 
        also are to be approved by annual general meetings. It is evident from 
        this that there is no scope of transferring money from the financial institutions 
        to somewhere else without recording transaction in the books of account. 
      </p>
      <p align="justify">Dr. Abul Barakat claimed that the net profit from the 
        fundamentalist non-government organizations and commercial organizations 
        is Taka 380 crore (31.6 percent of Taka 1200 crore. 20.8 percent of non-government 
        organizations and 10.8 percent from commercial organizations) [p 18].To 
        keep the readers in confusion, he did not explain which organizations 
        specifically represent non-government organizations and which represent 
        commercial organizations As an honest academic researcher he should have 
        provided a list of such organizations but possibly he did not do it intentionally. 
      </p>
      <p align="justify">Dr. Abul Barakat claimed that the net-profit earned from 
        the healthcare sector, including pharmaceutical industries and diagnostic 
        centers, amounts to Taka 125 crore (10.4 percent of Taka 1200 crore) [p 
        18]. In 2004 the annual profit of the pharmaceutical industry at Shafipur 
        after paying income tax was Taka 2 crore 86 lakh that was distributed 
        among 10,000 shareholders. The clinic at Dhanmondi belonging to the same 
        group is a Trust organization. In 2004 it made a profit of Taka 4 crore 
        10 lakh after paying income tax. Even if there are a few similar organizations 
        it is impossible that the net profits from this sector will add up to 
        Taka 125 crore. It is thus evident that the claim of Dr. Abul Barakat 
        that the fundamentalist economy earns Taka 125 crore annually from healthcare 
        including pharmaceutical industries and diagnostic centers is fantastic. 
        The statistics are imaginary having no link with truth. </p>
      <p align="justify">Dr. Abul Barakat claimed that the net profit from the 
        fundamentalist educational institutions is Taka 110 crore (9.2 percent 
        of Taka 1200 crore) [p 18]. This is an unrealistic proposition, utterly 
        impossible. The Madrasas of the country mainly depend on Zakah, Sadaqah 
        and donations. Everyone knows it. It is not clear to us how Dr. Abul Barakat 
        calculated this figure of Taka 110 crore. The few schools, colleges and 
        universities that have been established in the private sector by the country&#8217;s 
        eminent Islamic scholars, educationists and social workers are all Trust 
        organizations. Therefore, no person can take profit from such educational 
        institutions and the country&#8217;s law also does not permit that. </p>
      <p align="justify">Dr. Abul Barakat claimed that the net profit from the 
        fundamentalist news media and information technology sector is Taka 70 
        crore (5.8 percent of Taka 1200 crore) [p 18]. The daily published from 
        Moghbazar was never a profitable establishment and there have been periods 
        when journalists and workers of this daily have not been paid salary and 
        other allowances for consecutive eleven months. Possibly only one daily 
        published by the circle who believes in Islamic social transformation 
        is running successfully. The fundamentalists also do not have any news 
        agency or private television channel. It is not understandable how Dr. 
        Abul Barakat reached the figure of annual net profit of Taka 70 crore 
        from the fundamentalist news media and information technology sector. 
        He did not explain it either. </p>
      <p align="justify">Dr. Abul Barakat claimed that the net profit from the 
        fundamentalist real estate and transport sectors is Taka 190 crore (15.8 
        percent of Taka 1200 crore. 8.3 percent from real estate business and 
        7.5 percent from transport business). He did not mention the names of 
        the real estate houses and transport business organizations with which 
        the fundamentalists are associated. The figure of Taka 190 crore as income 
        from these two sectors as mentioned in his article is imaginary like the 
        statistics of other sectors. There is no doubt about it. </p>
      <p align="justify">Dr. Abul Barakat claimed that it is &#8220;possible to 
        engage 5 lakh party members for full time if only 10 percent of the annual 
        net profit of fundamentalist economy of Taka 1200 crore can be used in 
        organizational activities. This is what they (the fundamentalists) do 
        and give cross- subsidy in other sectors&#8221; [p 20]. </p>
      <p align="justify">Let us examine the matter in depth. 10 percent of Taka 
        1200 crore is Taka 120 crore with which the fundamentalist party gives 
        full time employment to 5 lakh party members. What does it mean? It means 
        one party member would get Taka 2400 per annum for &#8216;full time&#8217; 
        employment, monthly Taka 200 only. How reasonable is such salary structure 
        and how much it reflects the socio-economic condition of the country that 
        only Dr. Abul Barakat would better tell. If cross-subsidy is given to 
        other sectors then Taka 120 crore would not be available for full time 
        employment of party members. It that case, it would not be possible even 
        to give Taka 200 to a party member per month for full time employment.</p>
      <p align="justify">I am obliged to say that the article of Prof. Dr. Abul 
        Barakat is nothing but a concocted story devoid of truth. It is not a 
        well researched analytical economic discourse. The author cannot avoid 
        the accusation that by this article he has confused the people.#</p>
