      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The Indian sage Mahandas
      Karamchand Gandhi once remarked: “The world provides enough for every
      man’s need but not for every man’s greed”.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Ben Franklin said:
      “Those who would give up freedom for security deserve, and will get
      neither”.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The forward looking
      Iranian President Mohammad Khatami while addressing the UN General
      Assembly pointed out to the brutally unequal distribution of the 21<sup>st</sup>
      century global capitalism, arguing that “we cannot live in islands of
      prosperity and progress while the rest of the world is increasingly caught
      in poverty, illiteracy, disease and insecurity”.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">The West’s proclaimed peace is without justice.
      Its concept of justice is one sided. The West wants justice when only its
      interest is hurt. What we need is global endeavour to resolve conflicts
      and establish peace, with the participation of all nations, big or small,
      rich or poor, advanced or backward, Semitic or non-Semitic. In the same
      way, the solution of conflicts must be global, commented Uri Avnery, peace
      worker of Gush Shalom Movement. Nothing justifies killing innocent people,
      be in America or Afghanistan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
      West must sink criminal outrage and killing for the sake of killing. The
      West must revaluate its policy towards the Third World Arab and Muslim
      countries; leave its attitude of supremacy and work for genuine peace
      particularly in those regions of the world where terrorism is largely the
      result of colonialism, new or old. The West should not think that the
      people of the Third World countries are stupid and have forgotten that the
      British invaded Afghanistan in 1842 when there was no Osama Bin Laden,
      Mollah Umar, Taliban, Al Quida or any terrorist attack in the British
      mainland. Global peace today is at the crossroad. The international
      politics should be no more based on the notion that might make right.
      Global peace cannot be achieved by relying extensively on military might.
      What is however required, first and foremost, is to make sincere and
      genuine efforts to see the values of liberty, freedom, equality and
      dignity for humankind prevail throughout the world. The West must turn
      away from blatant moral hypocrisy and undeniable prejudice against Islam.
      This is reflected in US policy of closing down Muslim charities that feed
      starving children in Palestine, while allowing Jewish American to send
      over one billion dollars to Israeli settlers and terrorist groups like
      “Kach” to promote their terrorist activities, murder and expropriation
      of Palestine land. America can no longer sell its morality, respectability
      and creditability to the world. US must realize that its foreign policy is
      biased and morally wrong. Power is a two-edged sword. When used for
      justice it lasts, when misused it vanishes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>History of ancient civilizations- Greek, Roman, Persian and
      Egyptian- is the testimony of this fact and therefore in our time the
      so-called modern civilization should take lesson from this. Unfortunately
      September 11 is the anniversary of the League of Nations proclaiming in
      Palestine the British mandate in 1922. 2001 is however the United
      Nation’s year of dialogue of civilizations. Will the year end with a
      clash of civilizations- a clash between Islam and the West?</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The West in the past had
      always been propagating that the Arab and Muslim countries are
      technologically backward and that Islam or the Last Revealed Book of God;
      the Quran is the root cause of their backwardness. Now the big question
      is: When the Muslim world is as a whole backward, how then an individual
      Osama Bin Ladin or a group Al Qaida could mastermind such an accurate and
      precise attack with unthinkable precision on the WTC, the Twin Towers- a
      Western Minaret - and Pentagon. One wonders whether it is believable that
      the Arab and Muslim countries have advanced scientifically enough to
      particularly attack Pentagon, which is protected by highly sophisticated
      and sensitive technology. If not, why has U.S. targeted Afghanistan for
      giving sanctuary to Osama Bin Laden? Why this war is then fought? What is
      the hidden agenda behind U.S. attack on Afghanistan? Analysts believe that
      U.S. is after Afghanistan for strategic, military and economic reasons.
      U.S. economic interests in Afghanistan, Central Asia and Caucasus and
      Caspian region is so vital for the U.S. government that it has started an
      all out propaganda war to convince and persuade its public that its
      so-called commitment to freedom and democracy and the American way of life
      is under attack.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Beneath however lays the
      real motive. What is that? Why does veteran journalist Robert Fisk of
      Independent (10 December 2001) question this “War of Civilization” in
      the name of “good must triumph over evil”? Why is this “dubious
      battle”, to quote the title of John Steinbeck novel? Why President Bush
      so horridly declared a “crusade” against Afghanistan? The Western
      media and U.S. loose no time to establish its own justification and logic
      to attack Afghanistan, indeed an unequal war. What is the American way of
      life? Is it liberty, freedom and democracy at home and neo-colonialism
      outside in the name of so-called new world order, human rights, free
      market and globalization? U,S, to protect its sheer interests therefore
      support despotic dictatorial regimes in Third World countries and do not
      hesitate to intervene and use its armed forces. U.S. must shun its foreign
      policy of supporting the tyrants and dictators against the legitimate
      aspirations of the people of the Third World countries to fashion their
      lives, culture and economy as they wish and allow them to pursue their
      national independence and identity. U.S. must give up its old practice and
      willingness to support authoritarian and corrupt regimes as long as these
      governments serve and advance U.S. economic and strategic interests. Why
      U.S. government and president Bush Jr. in particular refused to produce
      solid and concrete evidence and not bias flimsy evidence to Arab and
      Muslim countries and O.I.C. in particular or to any U.N. Tribunal for the
      alleged involvement of Osama Bin Laden in the attack on Twin Towers-the
      two most spectacular buildings in the whole planet-and Pentagon? Is it
      because that the evidence it has would not stand in any court of law. What
      we need is an International Criminal Court to deal with all sorts of
      killers and terrorists. Unfortunately U.S. have not ratified the accord
      establishing International Criminal Court (ICC). President Bush gave
      ultimatum to the people of the world that “if you are not with us, you
      are against us”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Is it the
      U.S. demonstration of its commitment to freedom and liberty worldwide?
      What president Bush Jr. wants to convey by saying: Either you are with the
      West (us) or with the terrorists (Muslims). How a logical and rational
      person can say that the Muslims by refusing to assist the West against the
      fellow Muslims automatically become the supporter of terrorist? What will
      be the position of Sweden as a neutral country in such a situation? As far
      as the poor Third World countries are concerned the words liberty,
      freedom, independence, progress, wealth, technology and war have taken
      anew meaning and dimension. Attack on Afghanistan was not a war. War in
      Afghanistan was the West’s jingoistic drive for peace. The infinite
      justice in Afghanistan was the U.S. attempt to humiliate and dominate
      Afghanistan and enduring freedom was really enduring subjugation, to
      subjugate Afghanistan economically, militarily and culturally. U.S.
      refusal to provide evidence of the involvement of Osama Bin Laden, despite
      request from all quarters, is a gross violation of international law
      governing relations between states, human rights, rule of law and a
      demonstration of U.S. arrogance as a super power and its firm commitment
      to the principle of might is right and its dam attitude towards the global
      public opinion. U.S. policy of freedom inside the country means dominance
      and hegemony outside. When U.S. say that they love people outside the
      West; they really mean they hate non-Westerns who do not subscribe their
      views, culture and way of life. U.S. activities since the Two World Wars
      have proved that when they say, they want peace and stability in the
      non-Western countries, their real intention is to impose war in the name
      of peace to stop the onward march and progress of the Third World Arab and
      Muslim countries. Even two days before the attack on WTC and Pentagon
      eight people were killed in southern Iraq when U.S. and British planes
      bombed civilian areas which were not covered by the mainstream Western
      media to keep people in the dark, <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>U.N
      Media Peace Prize winner campaign journalist John Pilger commented. It is
      most unfortunate that the Western media largely behaves like a war
      propaganda machine in shaping public opinion, in projecting U.S. hegemony
      and dominance. The Western media’s ignorance and prejudice is pushing
      the world towards clash between civilizations. “Western terror is a part
      of the recent history of imperialism, a word that journalists dare not to
      speak or write”, commented John Pilger.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">The countries of the International Coalition
      against Afghanistan are the manufacturer of the deadly weapons of mass
      destruction and these are the countries that create circumstances whereby
      they can sell their weapons and test the effectiveness of these weapons.
      The Third World countries and Muslim regions in the Balkans are the
      killing ground of the Western producers of the weapons. Carlyle Group is
      reported to be the largest firm that invests in the defense sector (US $13
      billion) and makes money from military conflicts and weapon selling. Such
      persons run Carlyle as former U.S. Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci
      (Chairman and Managing Director and a college friend of Donald Rumsfeld),
      former US Secretary of State James Baker, George Soros (notorious for
      stabbing the Far Eastern rising economy) and Fred Maleek (George Bush
      Sr’s Campaign Manager). The Baltimore Chronicle reported that former US
      President George Bush Sr is seeking investments for the Carlyle Group from
      the Asian markets.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">The other business the Group is involved is oil. It
      is now an open secret that President George Bush Jr. and Vice President
      Dick Cheney made fortunes working in U.S. oil industry and their legacy
      with the oil company still continues. Now the readers can imagine why
      President Bush is so enthusiastic in the Afghan internal affairs. U.S.
      always viewed oil from security and strategic consideration and therefore
      ensured its presence in the West Asia and Gulf region. Turkmenistan, which
      borders the northwest Afghanistan, holds an estimated six billion barrels
      of oil reserves and the world’s third largest gas reserves, enough to
      meet U.S. energy needs for the next thirty years. The Unocal, the U.S. oil
      giant, has been negotiating with the Taliban for few years for permission
      to construct an oil pipeline through Afghanistan to Pakistan and out to
      Arabian Sea to off set the major impediments to American oil interest in
      the region from Iran and Russia. Unocal wanted access to the lucrative
      emerging markets of south and south Asia through this pipeline. In
      December 1997 Taliban representative also visited U.S. and met State
      Department officials. But when the discussion fizzled out “because of
      unbending Taliban regime” and Mollah Omar refused to give U.S. the
      facility to construct pipeline, the real problem surfaced. The U.S. with
      all its sophisticated monitoring system and intelligence network did not
      make any attempt to kidnap Osama Bin Laden (the alleged criminal in the
      eye of U.S. who mastermind the WTC and Pentagon attack) from Afghanistan
      like it kidnapped Noriega nor made any attempt to capture Osama Bin Laden
      as it tried to rescue its seized diplomats in Iran after the fall of the
      Shah of Iran rather decided to bring the fall of Taliban government by
      military might. Why?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
      not because of the so-called denial of fundamental rights to women; Afghan
      women in <i>hijab </i>or veil, for U.S. finds no wrong with the Saudi
      women in <i>hijab</i> (Women in Afghanistan follow a particular system of
      veil, <i>hijab</i> true to their tribal tradition. This is reflected from
      the fact that those women who have taken<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>refugee camps in Pakistan and out of the control of Mollah Omar
      follow the same <i>hijab.</i> Afghan women still follow the same <i>hijab</i>
      code even when the Northern Alliance has taken control of whole of
      Afghanistan) or the demolition of the two tallest sandstone Buddha statues
      in Bamiya, central Afghanistan for U.S. also did not raise its voice when
      the ancient Babri Mosque was demolished by the Indian Hindu
      fundamentalists although U.S. used these issues to pursue its hidden
      agenda, the “politics of petroleum”. To U.S. economic and
      geo-political interests remain always high. Other considerations are
      secondary and sometimes insignificant. This is reflected from the
      statement of Madeleine Albright the then U.S. Secretary of State. In 1996
      when she was interviewed by CBS television by Leslie Stahl and asked on
      what she felt about the fact that 500,000 Iraqi children had died as a
      result of U.S. sanction, she replied that is was “a very hard choice”,
      but that, all things considered, “we think the price is worth it”.
      “In U.S, the arms industry, the oil industry, the major media network
      and indeed the U.S. foreign policy all are controlled the same business
      combine”, commented Booker Prize Winning author and journalist Arundhati
      Roy.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">The Caspian Sea region has potentially the
      world’s largest oil reserve, likely making Central Asia the next Middle
      East. The problem is piping it out. Afghanistan occupies a strategic
      position between the Caspian and the markets of the Indian subcontinent
      and East Asia. Its prime concern is building pipelines, which are why the
      oil company Unocal, as well the U.S. government, welcomed the Taliban rise
      to power in 1996 as a promising source of “stability”. That however
      turned out to be a “dream”. President Bush, the US Commander-in-Chief
      and the oilmen around him have never given up on the tremendous profit
      possibilities that Central Asia offers. Unfortunately this is the real
      issue of conflict, which must not escape the attention of the foreign
      policy analysts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">John Pilger in an article in the London Mirror (29
      October 2001) commenting on the U.S. imposed war on Afghanistan described
      the war as “a cover war” and “a means of achieving American
      strategic aims that lie behind the flag-waving façade of great power”,
      a war of attrition of “the powerful against the powerless, with new
      excuses, new hidden agenda, new lies”. Pilger in his article mentioned
      that on the day of Twin Towers attack, an “arms fair” selling weapons
      of terror (like cluster bombs and missiles) to assorted tyrants and human
      rights abusers, opened in London with the full backing of Blair
      government. People of the Middle East and South Asia have been victims
      largely of the West’s exploitation of precious natural resources in or
      near their countries, Pilger pointed out. This is the hidden agenda of the
      West. The genocidal blockade of Iraq is causing more deaths of infants
      every month than the number killed in the World Trade Center. But the U.S.
      conscience never awakens for the scene of incident is not their heartland
      but in far-away places beyond the seas. ‘Prayer service is neither
      organized for these innocent children killed nor a concert with Paul
      McCartney nor their death is condoled’. Malaysian academician and human
      rights activists Dr. Chandra Muzaffar raised the question: “Why is that
      after it was known that a white crew-cut member of a right-wing militia
      that bombed the Oklahoma Federal Building in 1995 and killed more than a
      hundred people, there was no mass, or even a limited, expression of
      collective anger and venom towards crew-cut militia in different parts of
      the States”?</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">The oil and gas reserves of Central Asia have been
      controlled by Russia. Bush government wanted to change that. But Taliban
      refused to accept U.S. conditions. This changed the U.S. rationale of
      energy security “into a military one”. This was claimed in the book
      “<i>Bin Ladin: La Verite Interdite</i>” (Bin Laden: The Formidable
      Truth), jointly authored by Jean-Charles Brisard and Guillaume Dasquie,
      reported IPS from Paris. [Brisard and Dasquie have long experience in
      intelligence analysis. Brisard was until the late 1990s director of
      economic analysis and strategy for Vivendi, a French company. He also
      worked for French secret services, and wrote for them in 1997 a report on
      the now famous Al Qaida network. Dasquie is an investigative journalist
      and publisher of Intelligence Online, a respected newsletter on diplomacy,
      economic analysis and strategy, available through the Internet].<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The writers claimed that until August 2001, the U.S. government saw
      Taliban regime as a source of stability in Central Asia which they thought
      would enable U.S. to construct an oil pipeline from across Central Asia,
      from rich oilfields in Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, through
      Afghanistan and Pakistan, to the Indian Ocean. At one stage of the
      negotiations, the U.S. representative told the Taliban: “Either you
      accept our offer of a carpet of gold, or we bury you under a carpet of
      bombs”, the authors of the book claimed in an interview in Paris. The
      last meeting between U.S. and Taliban representatives took place in
      August, five weeks before the incident in New York and Washington in which
      Christaian Rocca, in charge of Central Asian affairs for the U.S.
      government was present.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">Bush’s family has a strong oil background. So are
      his top aides.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>From the U.S.
      Vice President Dick Cheney, through the Director of the National Security
      Council Condoleeza Riec, to the Ministers of Commerce and Energy, Donald
      Evans and Stanley Abraham, all have worked for U.S. oil companies. Cheney
      was until the end of the year 2000 President of Halliburton, a company
      that provides services for oil industry; Rice was between 1991 to 2000
      Manager for Chevron; Evans and Abraham worked for Tom Brown, another oil
      giant.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">The book confirmed the earlier reports that U.S.
      government worked closely with U.N. during the negotiations with Taliban.
      Several meetings took place last year (2001), under the arbitration of
      Francese Vendrell, personal representative of U.N Secretary General Kofi
      Annan to discuss the situation in Afghanistan. Representatives of the U.S.
      government and Russia, and the six countries that border with Afghanistan
      were present at these meetings. Sometimes representatives of the Taliban
      also sat around the table. These meetings also called “6+2” because of
      the number of states (six neighbours plus U.S. and Russia) involved. Naif
      Naik, former Minister for Foreign Affairs, government of Pakistan also
      confirmed about these meetings. In a recent French television news
      programme Naif Naik said that during the “6+2” meeting in Berlin held
      in July, discussion turned around the formation of a government of
      national unity. If Taliban had accepted this coalition, they would have
      immediately received international economic aid and the pipelines from
      Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan would have come. Naif Naik also claimed that Tom
      Simons, the U.S. representative at these meetings, openly threatened the
      Taliban and Pakistan. Simons said: “Either the Taliban behave as they
      ought to, or Pakistan convinces them to do so, or we will use another
      option”. The words Simons used were “a military operation”’ Naif
      Naik claimed.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">So the natural question is who will benefit from
      the Afghan war? The answer is obvious. Everyone in the oil industry will
      benefit, specially the Bush family and their business partners. Everyone
      in the defense industry complex will benefit, commented William Copper.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">It is now clear that
      anthrax is being produced in the laboratories of U.S. pharmaceutical
      industries to open up new markets for antibiotic medicine and to discredit
      Arab and Muslims; this was claimed by German based Green Peace Environment
      Movement. Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Muhammad expressed his
      suspicions that anthrax terrorism in the U.S. was the work of “violent
      rightist Christian”. He raised question on the moral standard of the
      West. “While there is talk about of attacking Iraq, there is no violent
      rage against the spreading of anthrax”, the Malaysian Premier said, AFP
      reported from Kuala Lampur. The Western morality is further exposed in the
      survey conducted by ICM for the News of the World newspaper. The survey
      showed tremendous increase of popularity of the British Prime Minister
      Tony Blair as a ‘war leader’ due to his unflinching support to
      President Bush’s military invasion in Afghanistan. The survey indicated
      that 67 percent of the Britons supported Blair’s action as a result of
      which there was unimaginable loss of civilian lives in Afghanistan, old,
      women and children, indeed mounting loss of innocent lives with terrible
      catastrophe, reported Reuters from London.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">What motivated U.S. not to
      produce evidence?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To use its
      military might and establish base in Afghanistan and use Afghanistan as
      springboard. British Prime Minister Tony Blair promised to the Afghan
      people: “This time we will not walk away from you”. President Bush
      addressing the gathering at national day of prayer and remembrance service
      at the National Cathedral at Washington DC expressed his firm
      determination to continue war in Afghanistan. He said: “This conflict
      was begun on the timing and terms of others. It will end in a way, and at
      an hour, of our choosing”.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Pakistan former Army Chief General Mirza Aslam Beg claimed
      that U.S. had no evidence against Osama Bin Laden or Afghanistan being
      involved with the attack of WTC and Pentagon, but the U.S. media had
      created an atmosphere against them. “This is a trick to achieve a
      particular objective”, General Bag warned. He warned that there is a
      serious threat to Pakistan’s nuclear installations (Dawn.Lahore.16
      September 2001). And of course there is necessity of containing China and
      keeping Russia at bay. [Xinhua from Moscow reported on 23 December 2001
      that Russia has already urged U.S. to remove its military bases from
      Central Asian countries since the military action in Afghanistan is over].</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">According to renowned Pak journalist Hamid Mir
      President Bush is anti-Taliban because the Taliban has refused to oblige
      U.S. request. In an article in The Friday Times (September 14-20, 2001) he
      underlined that U.S. had a three point agenda for the Taliban. One, they
      would use the Taliban against the Iran. Two, they would like to pressurize
      them to arrange shelter and training camps to the rebels of Shin kiang in
      Afghanistan. And three, the American wanted to construct a gas pipeline
      from Turkmenistan to Pakistan through Afghanistan. Northern Alliance was
      in fact engaged in training a number of youth for infiltration and
      carrying out subversion activities in Xinjiang to blame eventually Taliban
      and Pakistani <i>mujahideen.</i> The training was being provided by the
      Indian intelligence agency RAW and their Israeli counterpart Mossad. Some
      Americans posing as foreign journalists also visited Darul Uloom Haqqania,
      in Akora Khatak, and tried to convince its head Moulana Sami-ul-Haq, to
      lend its support to raise his voice against ‘Chinese repression’ in
      Xinjiang. U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan William B Millam for the very same
      purpose paid frequent visits to the Frontier Province without informing
      the Pakistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as the protocol requires
      (Plotting ‘Jihad’ against China. p 27. Impact International.UK.
      Vol.31.No. 6.June 2001). The same issue of the Impact also reported that
      U.S. Department of Defense was “shocked” on the signing of MOU between
      Pakistan and China for construction of deep-sea port at Gawader providing
      strategic outlet to China on the vitally important Mekran Coast (ibid.
      page 15-16). But all U.S, Israeli and Indian efforts to involve any
      Islamic group of Pakistan against China so far failed.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">In October 1995, the California based Unocal Oil
      Company signed a protocol with Turkmenistan government to explore the
      prospect of constructing an oil pipeline to Pakistan through Afghan
      territory. When the Taliban captured Kabul, the Vice President of Unocal,
      Christopher Taggart, confidently stated: “We regard it as very
      positive”. Robert Oakley, former US Ambassador in Pakistan was in due
      course hired by Unocal for lobbing its cause and was busy shuttling
      between Washington and Islamabad, but Taliban refused to oblige Unocal. In
      November 1996 former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for South Asian
      Affairs Robin Raphel went to Kandahar and had a meeting with top Taliban
      officials, but the policy of engagement failed because the Taliban signed
      memorandum of understanding with Bridas, an Argentinean company, to
      develop the proposed gas pipeline. Ultimately when the U.S. $8 billion
      pipeline project had become a non-starter, U.S. flared up and demanded
      extradition of Osama Bin Laden, which they refused. This assertion of
      independence by Taliban government enraged U.S. and it decided to install
      a government of its own choice in Kabul, when Taliban was controlling 95%
      of Afghanistan, with the intention to take control of all road links to
      Central Asia. America clearly wanted to create problem not only for
      Pakistan and China but also for Iran. The real crime of Taliban is that it
      refused to become U.S. puppets. Had they submitted to U.S. hegemony and
      worked for the American economic interest in the region Taliban would have
      remained an “indigenous movement” and “not fundamentalist or
      terrorist” and if it agreed to be used to destabilize Chinese Muslim
      provinces, all their subsequent problems would not have at all been there.
      Now with the fall of Afghanistan the British troops are already in Kabul
      as the head of an International Security Assistance Force setup under
      Security Council Resolution created under chapter seven of U.N. Charter
      for maintaining, what it called, peace in war ravaged Afghanistan. It is
      highly suspected that in no time U.S, Israel and Indian intelligence will
      occupy all the bases close to Pakistan’s northern and western borders.
      It is believed that these countries will start their covert operations not
      only against nuclear installation of Pakistan but also against Iran and
      China. The Independent in its issue of 25 December 2001 reported that U.S.
      have given green signal to Israel to sell to India Phalcon airborne radar
      system, three Phalcon Airborne Warning and Control Systems (AWACS) worth
      one billion dollars.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">No doubt America is a massive military and economic
      power and its arms of influence extend far beyond its shore. It does not
      require a military alliance to force the downfall of ‘tiny’
      Afghanistan but for “political reason”. History also testifies that
      Afghans are an indomitable people not to be subjugated. The guerilla war
      is likely to continue if foreign troops are stationed in its soil even if
      under U.N. flag. It is like inviting a brick to drop through your
      windscreen. “Every country is afraid that if they swallow a piece of
      Afghanistan, the Afghans would be their enemy until hell freezes over”,
      commented Alam Payind, Director of the Middle East Studies Center at Ohio
      State University (New York Times. I December 2001)</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">Although it has not been established without any
      shadow of doubt that Osama Bin Laden is involved with the attack of the
      WTC and Pentagon but nonetheless Robert Fisk writing in The Independent UK
      (12 September 2001) raised the question why so many Muslims hate the West.
      America has bankrolled Israel’s wars for so many years that it believed
      this would be cost-free. No, it would not be no longer so. The West has
      now to face the music, the suicide bombers. The fight is now between
      theology and technology.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">Now the question remains to be answered what the
      Third World countries, especially the Arab and Muslim countries should do
      in the face of U.S. unjustified behaviour. Now is the time to boycott
      non-essential U.S. products. Eminent Islamic scholar and <i>dayee </i>Dr.
      Yusuf Al Qaradawi made an appeal to the Muslims worldwide. He said: The
      time has come for the Muslim <i>ummah</i> to say no to America, no to its
      companies and no to its goods, for we are eating, drinking, wearing and
      riding whatever American produces, thus contributing to her world
      dominance. Boycotting is the most effective weapon used in the past
      especially by the weak. No body can bomb others for not buying its goods.
      People of India boycotted British goods in their struggle for
      independence. This is a choice that empowers ordinary men, women and
      children in the street. And this is the minimum we all can do to stand up
      against the global tyranny and injustice.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">The Arab and Muslim countries should also make
      sincere and serious endeavours to reduce its economic dependence on the
      West and their extended arms, the World Bank, IMF and WTO which often
      “terrorize” the poor Third World countries and depend more on the
      internal resources rather than aid and grant for that would enable them to
      become really free from the imposed, unjustified and unethical dictation
      of the West. The Muslim leadership has so far failed to crystallize the
      dream of the common people of the Muslim countries to establish an Islamic
      Common Market, which can rightfully safeguard economic interest of these
      countries. This is the proper time to take effective and concrete measures
      in this regard. Arab and Muslim countries should also develop their own
      technology, which is another vital area where they are lagging behind. Al
      Jazeera Television Qatar has played very significant and meaningful role
      in projecting the Muslim views in the recent past in the face of
      prejudiced, unfriendly and immoral propaganda by the Western media. It is
      high time that the affluent Arab and Muslim countries realize the need to
      develop their own television networks, which shall be no less than BBC,
      CNN etc television channels.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">Note: This article will remain incomplete if a word
      is not said about the perception of Islam about terrorism. Terrorism is
      terrorism whether it is sponsored by motivated groups or sponsored by the
      state. It is immaterial whether the effected people of such terrorism
      belongs all-powerful U.S. or poverty stricken and backward Afghanistan.
      But distinction must be made between terrorism and oppressed people
      fighting for national identity and self-determination particularly when
      such people find no way to express their legitimate grievances and take up
      arms for national liberation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Islam
      is always against the killing of innocent people, unarmed civilians, old,
      women, and children and combatants when they lay down their arms. The
      teaching of Islam is that Muslims cannot feel happy at the pain and agony
      of others, whether they are Muslims or non-Muslims. The Holy Quran
      addressing believers said: “… let not the enmity and hatred of others
      make you avoid justice…” [Al Quran –5 (Surat Al Maidah): 8]. The
      celebrated commentator of the Holy Quran Muhammad Asad in his commentary
      ‘The Message of the Quran’ translated this verse “… never let
      hatred of anyone lead you into the sin of deviating from justice…” </p>
