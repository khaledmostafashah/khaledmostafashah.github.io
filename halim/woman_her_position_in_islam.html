      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">In my article ‘Islam and Democracy: How far 
      Compatible’ published in The New Nation on 11 March 2006 I discussed, as a 
      corollary of the women’s political participation and empowerment, the 
      question whether it is obligatory on the part of Muslim women to fully 
      cover face or use nikab</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt;text-align:justify">In 
      response to my article Mr. Mohammad Sakhi in the every first paragraph of 
      his article under the heading ‘Islam and Democracy’ published in The New 
      Nation 0n 17 April 2006 pointed out that I have written that ‘veiled women 
      are not required to lower down their gaze when she faces opposite sex’.&nbsp; 
      This statement does not correctly represent the words as to what I have 
      said in my article although some might infer such a farfetched conclusion. 
      I would request Mr. Mohammad Sakhi to read my previous article. I shall 
      however further explain here at this stage my position on ‘lowering of 
      gaze’ for the benefit of readers.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">The question that I discussed in my previous 
      article is whether the Muslim women shall have to fully cover the face or 
      use nikab. Referring verse to 24: 30-31 wherein both men and women have 
      been asked to lower their look when fall on the opposite sex I took up the 
      position that “the instruction of the verses quoted above is that both men 
      and women are required to keep their eye cast down, so that when they meet 
      each other, neither should men stare at women nor women at men. The 
      natural question that arises is why man should lower his gaze if the face 
      of woman is totally covered? From the text of the verses it is clearly 
      evident that the face of the woman is not to be covered and therefore man 
      has been advised to lower his look”. My understanding of the Text of the 
      Quran is that women are not required to cover face or wear nikab. Others 
      might differ with me.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Imam Abu Hanifa and majority of the scholars 
      support the view that women need not cover their face although some other 
      scholars hold different view. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Amazingly enough, the most important thing today is 
      that the opinion cited should be old; the writer’s reputation or the 
      work’s value does not matter. There is however no reason to think our 
      earlier generations have done all the research and investigation and we 
      have nothing to add. In this connection, the Farewell Pilgrimage message 
      of the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) is very 
      pertinent in which he called upon those who are present on the occasion to 
      convey his message to those who are not present adding that those who will 
      come to know about his message later might understand the inner meaning 
      and significance of his message more than who are present [Zahir Ahmed, 
      Muhammad: Glimpses of the Prophet’s Life &amp; Times, Royal Book Company, 
      Karachi, Pakistan, p 200. Also Prof. Syed Ali Asan, Muhammad: Seal of the 
      Prophets, Dhaka, p 345 and Dr. M. Said Ramadan Al Buti, The Jurisprudence 
      of the Prophetic Biography &amp; A Brief History of the Orthodox Caliphate, 
      Dar Al Fikr, Damascus, pp 651-652]. It is no good to conclude that ‘modern 
      Muslims influenced by western philosophy and technology are inclined to 
      imitate them at the cost of our culture and civilization … have developed 
      a mentality of western path’ as&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Mohammad Sakhi in his article has 
      observed while making comments on my position on Hijab. We must not 
      overlook the general practice of Hijab by women in Indonesia, Malaysia, 
      Iraq, Palestine, Lebanon, Egypt and Morocco where they keep their face 
      open and they do not cover their face with nikab. Women in the Saudi 
      Television also appear without nikab, without covering the face. Even the 
      women leaders of Ikhwan-al-Muslimin, Muslim Brotherhood throughout Middle 
      East, including eminent Ikhwan leader of Egypt Zainab al Ghazali known for 
      his monumental work “Return of the Pharoah: Memoirs in Naser’s Prison’, do 
      not cover their face. It is obligatory that women must not cover their 
      face during Hajj.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">In this connection, it would be appropriate to 
      quote Hadith of Prophet Muhammad in which he said: Hazrat Ayesha reports a 
      Tradition that her sister Asma once came in thin clothes and Prophet 
      Muhammad turned his face away from her and remarked: O Asma when a girl 
      attains maturity, she is not permitted to expose any part of her body 
      except face and hand” [Abu Daud quoted in Muhammad Sharif Chaudhury’s 
      Women’s Right in Islam, Adam Publishers &amp; Distributors, New Delhi, 2003, 
      pp 99, 104. Also see Katherine Bullock, Rethinking Muslim Women and the 
      Veil: Challenging Historical &amp; Modern Stereotypes, IIIT, U. S. A., 2003, p 
      232]. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Now let us discuss Mr. Mohammad Sakhi’s observation 
      that ‘if husband does not allow her (wife) to go for pilgrimage <b>(</b>Hajj) 
      she cannot go’. Hajj is a obligatory ibadah, prayer also for woman if she 
      fulfills the conditions for Hajj namely she is in good health, she has her 
      own money, wealth and resources to bear the expenses and a muharram- a 
      brother or a son and so on who is willing to accompany her during 
      pilgrimage. Husband cannot stop wife from performing Fard, obligatory 
      prayer and there is no obedience that contradicts obedience to Allah and 
      His Prophet and obedience is only on maruf and not on munkar [Bukhari 
      Muslim quoted in Sayyid Abul Ala Mawdudi’s Islamic Law and Constitution. 
      Bengali tr Islami Rastro O Shongbidhan Dhaka, 1997, p 129], that means we 
      can expect obedience only lawful commands, on good things and we cannot 
      expect obedience when the command is on unlawful matter, on doing evil [Bukhari, 
      Muslim, Tabrani and Sharhus Sunnah quoted in ibid p 252]. <u>&nbsp;</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Mr. Mohammad Sakhi’s observation that ‘woman cannot 
      be summoned to the court if she is prudah observing’. This is something 
      not understandable. Indeed some Muslim scholars have engrossed themselves 
      in woman studies emphasizing biological and psychological differences, 
      thereby attempting to derive evidence from Islam to support their 
      attitude. Such a decidedly un-Islamic bias has prevented Muslims scholars 
      from considering the issue of the woman’s testimony in the light of 
      broader Quranic teachings of equality. Shaykh Taha Jabir Al-Alwani, 
      President of The Fiqh Council of North America and Member of the OIC 
      Islamic Fiqh Council observed: “In essence, Muslim jurists and Quranic 
      commentators allowed their cultural prejudices to color their discussions 
      on women” [The Testimony of Women in Issues in Contemporary Islamic 
      Thought, IIIT, U. S. A., 2005, p 166].&nbsp;&nbsp; Imam Abu Hanifa is of the view 
      that that “since the Quran indicated that women may serve as witnesses in 
      financial transactions, they may also judge on financial and other 
      matters” [Dr. Jamal Badawi, Islamic Teachings Course, Islamic Schools 
      Trust, 2 Digswell Street, London N7 8JX, England, vol. 3, p 50. Bengali 
      tr. Islami Shikkha Series, BIIT, Dhaka, 2006 p 328]. “Witnessing is 
      mentioned seven times in the Quran, and on only one occasion is there a 
      requirement that if two men are not present, a man and two women will 
      suffice (2: 282). In verse 24: 6-9 it is clear that the testimony of a 
      woman is equated <i>exactly </i>with that of a man in case of adultery: 
      where one spouse accuses the other of infidelity, the accusation by one 
      spouse is held to be just as valid as the denial by the other. In other 
      five verses on witnessing (4:15. 5:106-107, 24: 4, 24: 13, 65: 2), the 
      Quran does not specify whether witnesses should be men, women or a 
      combination of them” [Abdul Qadr Auda, Criminal Law in Islam, p 315,&nbsp; 
      quoted in Dr. Jamal Badawi’s Islamic Teachings Course, vol. 3, pp&nbsp; 51-54. 
      Bengali tr. Islami Shikkha Series, pp 330-333]. “Sayings from the 
      prophetic tradition seem to contradict the view that, as in financial 
      matters, there must be two men or one man and two women; for instance, 
      according to tradition, the Prophet is reported as having settled many 
      disputes on the basis of one statement under oath and one witness – there 
      is no indication whether the witness was a <i>male or female</i> i.e. it 
      could have been either” [Dr. Jamal Badawi, Islamic Teachings Course, vol. 
      3, p 52. Bengali tr. Islami Shikkha Series, p 331]. If we fall back on 
      history we find that woman as witness appeared before the Qadi during the 
      four rightly guided Caliphs and afterwards during the Umayyad and the 
      Abbasid period. Even today Muslim women appear in the courts in Saudi 
      Arabia and Iran not to speak of other Muslim countries.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">In this connection it would be appropriate to quote 
      Hadith of Prophet Muhammad: Wael-b-Hujr reported that a woman came out at 
      the time of the Messenger of Allah intending to say prayer. A man forced 
      her and dragged her and satisfied his lust with her. She raised alarm but 
      he went away. She passed by a host of the refugees and said: That man did 
      with me such and such thing. They over took him and came with him to the 
      Messenger of Allah. He said to her: Go back because Allah has forgiven you 
      and he said about the man: Stone him to death. [Tirmizi, Abu Daud quoted 
      in Women’s Right in Islam, p 78]. Is this not a proof that a lady appeared 
      before the Court of Prophet Muhammad.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Mr. Mohammad Sakh observed: ‘Our scripture never 
      allows free mixing (of men and women) and soft speech (by women) with 
      unknown persons … how far modern female is correct when she defies Allah’s 
      command in the public hall meeting and Parliament House, when she speaks 
      and announces in radio and television and serves as a hostess in aircraft 
      with smiling face and sweet tone’. Prof. Dr. Yusuf Al Qaradawi is of 
      opinion that “Islam prohibits Khulwah between a man and a woman who are 
      outside the degree of mahrem relationship” [The Lawful and the Prohibited 
      in Islam, American Trust Publications, U. S. A., p 150. Bengali tr. Islame 
      Halal Haramer Bidhan, Khairun Prokashani, Dhaka, 1999, p 200]. What is not 
      allowed in Islam is “meet in private” and “male and female should not be 
      alone together” [Islamic Teachings Course, vol. 3, p 71.<u> </u>Bengali 
      tr. Islami Shikkha Series, p 357]. As regards soft speech it appears in 
      verse 33: 32 of the Quran and the verse is “directed to the wives of the 
      Prophet … it applies only to them” [Maha Azzam, Gender and the Politics of 
      Religion in the Middle East in Mai Yamani ed. Feminism and Islam: Legal 
      and Literary Perspectives, New York University Press, U. S. A., 1996, p 
      224]. We must not overlook the fact that Hazrat Ayesha, herself a Fuqaha, 
      taught Quran and Hadith to the Companions of the Prophet. Women can go out 
      when necessary and Prof. Dr. Yusuf Al Qaradawi is of opinion that women 
      can be a Member of Parliament and can serve as judge [Dr. Zeenath Kausar, 
      Political Participation of Women: Contemporary Perspectives of Gender 
      Feminists &amp; Islamic Revivalists, published by A. S. Noordeen, Kuala 
      Lumpur, 1997, p 31].&nbsp; In Turkey only recently Marve Kavaki, a woman Member 
      of the Parliament from an Islamic Party entered the House in decent dress, 
      in proper Hijab – keeping the face open, and she was expelled from the 
      Parliament. People made uproar not because she has become a Member of 
      Parliament but why she was denied to stay in the Parliament with Hijab.

      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Replying a question: ‘Can it be said that the way 
      in which a woman overturned a proposal by Umar to limit the amount of mahr 
      that is paid resembles the modern parliamentary process’ Dr. Jamal Badwi 
      replied: “There are six ways in which it is possible to draw a parallel 
      between what happened during the reign of Umar and what happens today in 
      parliament. (a) When Umar stood up in the mosque to propose a ceiling in 
      the amount that was payable for mahr, it was in fact the Government 
      producing a proposal to reform a particular aspect of marriage law. (b) 
      The venue for the discussion may not have been a parliamentary building, 
      (it was the mosque), but in Islam, the mosque is not just a place of 
      worship. The mosque has traditionally been used by Muslims to discuss and 
      decide on social issues, political issues etc. – armies were often sent 
      out from the mosque, foreign emissaries were received there and so on. 
      Although there were no official delegates serving as members of the House, 
      nevertheless it was similar to parliament because people would gather 
      there to hear what their ruler had to say and have discussion with him. 
      (c) The fact that Umar made his proposal in public suggests that people 
      were entitled to express their opinion about his decisions. (d) People 
      from all walks of life were present and could freely criticize if they 
      wished. (e)&nbsp; In the event it was a woman who voiced criticism of the 
      proposal, and the basis of her objection was that the proposal violated 
      the terms of the Constitution: for Muslims the Quran, the word of Allah, 
      is the Constitution and no human being can change any aspect of its 
      provisions. (f) Umar, on understanding the point that the woman made, 
      immediately withdrew his proposed law, conceding that it was 
      unconstitutional” [Islamic Teachings Course, vol. 3, p 49. Bengali 
      tr.Islami Shikkha Series, pp 326-327].</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">To sum up, I have tried in the three articles (Part 
      1, 2 and 3) to answer some of the issues raised by Mr. Mohammad Sakhi 
      which I thought important and relevant. I did not however respond to some 
      other problems pertaining to Egypt and Turkey raised by Mr. Mohammad Sakhi 
      though important as the article has already become too big in size for 
      publication in newspaper. </p>
      <p align="justify"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">I want to
