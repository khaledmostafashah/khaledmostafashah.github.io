font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">The duty of the journalists, inter alia,
      includes reporting incident, making comment in the form of personal
      column, commentary and writing editorial. Above all the press being the
      fourth estate does exert political power and influence as watch dog and
      discharge its responsibility for the general good of the people, society
      and the state at large. A question however frequently been raised whether
      Islam provides any guideline or code of conduct for the journalists in the
      discharge of their responsibility and obligation. In answering this
      question we must fall back on the Holy Quran, the last Revealed Book and
      the sunnah, the Tradition of the Holy Prophet Salla Allahu ‘Alayhi Wa
      Sallam<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(saws)- May peace
      &amp; blessings of Allah be upon him. <o:p>

font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Indeed in the sight of Allah Subhanahu
      Wa Ta’ala (Glory and Praise be to Allah) all people including the
      journalists who are engaged in the pursuit of knowledge are honourable.
      The first verse of the Holy Quran is: Read in the name of thy Lord Who
      created [Al Quran 96 (Sura Al Alaq): 1]. It then follows: He Who taught
      the use of the pen (i.e. writing) [Al Quran 96 (Sura Al Alaq): 4]. The
      journalists remain very much busy in reading and writing or in other words
      in the pursuit of knowledge throughout their professional career. It is
      therefore naturally expected that man being the vicegerent or <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Khalifa
      </i>of the Creator on the earth [Al Quran 2 (Surat Al Baqarah): 30] should
      remain conscious of his/her responsibility of attaining the pleasure of
      his/her Master [Al Quran 48 (Sura Al Fath): 29] by following the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Siratul
      Mustaqim</i> [Al Quran 1(Surat Al Fatiha): 6], the Straight Path. Man has
      to pass a time in this world [Al Quran 2 (Surat Al Baqarah): 36] and after
      death on the day of Resurrection he/she will be awarded for his/her
      actions in this life [Al Quran 3 (Surat Al Imran): 185]. It is through the
      remembrance and consciousness of the Creator and the Day of Judgement that
      Islam instill in each individual the sense of accountability. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">This
      accountability has been made distinct which is the guiding principle of
      just reporting. Al Quran states: And cover not truth with falsehood, nor
      conceal the truth when you know what it is [Al Quran 2 (Surat Al Baqarah):
      42]. In another verse Al Quran states: …whenever you speak (i.e.
      express) speak (i.e. express) justly …[Al Quran 6 (Surat Al Anam): 152].
      Holy Quran states: And pursue not that of which you have no knowledge; for
      every act of hearing or seeing or of the feeling in the heart will be
      enquired into on the Day of Reckoning [Al Quran 17 (Surat Bani Israil):
      36]. Al Quran further elaborates: And he who brings the truth and he who
      confirms and supports it- such are the men who do right [Al Quran 39 (Sura
      Az Zumar): 33]. Al Quran states: …so judge you between men in truth and
      justice and follow not your desire- for it will mislead you from the Path
      of Allah … [Al Quran 38 (Sura Sad): 26]. Prophet Muhammad (saws) said:
      That which is lawful is clear and also that which is unlawful is quite
      clear; and between these two is that which is ambiguous, which most people
      do not know. One who avoids the doubtful, safeguards his faith and his
      honour (Riyadh-Us-Saleheen - R.S. 588). Holy Prophet (saws) said: Leave
      alone that which involves you in doubt and adhere to that which is free
      from doubt for truth is comforting and falsehood is disturbing (R.S 55).
      Holy Prophet (saws) is reported to have said: A perfect Muslim is neither
      a taunter, a curser, an abuser, nor one having a long tongue (R.S. 1555).
      Holy Prophet (saws) said: Allah hates the person who twists his tongue in
      eloquence while talking (R.S. 1737). Al Quran states: When you are
      propagating it with your tongues and uttering with your mouths that
      whereof you had no knowledge; and you thought it to be a light matter,
      while it was most serious in the sight of Allah [Al Quran 24 (Sura An Nur):
      15]. Holy Quran states: Whoever intercedes in a good cause becomes a
      partner therein and whoever recommends and helps an evil cause shares in
      its burden … [Al Quran 4 (Surat An Nisa): 85]. Al Quran states: Cursed
      be the conjecturers [Al Quran 51 (Sura Az Zariyat): 10]. Holy Quran
      states: …Those who stir up sedition in the city (i.e. put false rumours
      in circulation to excite the crowd), desist not, We shall certainly stir
      thee up against them … [Al Quran 33 (Sura Al Ahzab): 60]. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;

      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">The
      journalists who write editorials, columns and commentaries or give views
      in various issues have the moral responsibility of advocating
      righteousness. Al Quran states: Let there arise out of you a band of
      people inviting to all that is good, enjoining what is right and
      forbidding what is wrong … [Al Quran 3 (Surat Al Imran): 104]. Prophet
      Muhammad (saws) said: You should enjoin virtue and check evil (R.S. 193).
      Another verse of the Holy Quran states: … Verily the most honoured of
      you in the sight of Allah is he who is the most righteous of you … [Al
      Quran 49 (Sura Al Hujurat): 13]. Al Quran states: … Stand out firmly for
      Allah as witnesses to fair dealing and let not the hatred of others to you
      make you swerve to wrong and depart from justice. Be just, that is next to
      piety and fear Allah … [Al Quran 5 (Surat Al Maida): 8]. Holy Quran
      states: … Stand out firmly for justice … follow not the lusts of your
      hearts lest you may avoid justice and if you distort your witness or
      refuse to give it … [Al Quran 4 (Surat An Nisa): 135]. Al Quran states:
      … We shall hide not the evidence we owe to Allah. If we do, then behold,
      we shall be sinners [Al Quran 5 (Surat Al Maida): 106]. Holy Quran states:
      That is the most suitable that they may give the evidence in its true
      nature and shape …[Al Quran 5 (Surat Al Maida): 108]. Al Quran states:
      … Only say those words that are best … [Al Quran 17 (Surat Bani Israil):
      53].<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Al Quran states: …
      Whoever expects to meet his Lord, let him work righteousness … [Al Quran
      18 (Surat Al Khaf): 110]. <o:p>

      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Journalists
      should present thing in clear and distinct language. It should not be
      ambiguous or allegorical and should be understood fully. Al Quran states:
      … Warn openly and without ambiguity [Al Quran 15 (Surat Al Hijr): 89].
      … But what is the mission of messengers but to preach the clear message
      [Al Quran 16 (Surat Al Nahl): 35]. … I am sent to you only to give a
      clear warning [Al Quran 22 (Sura Al Hajj): 49]. … The Messenger’s duty
      is only to preach the clear message [Al Quran 24 (Sura An Nur): 54]. …
      And the duty of the Messenger is only to preach publicly and clearly [Al
      Quran 29 (Sura Al Ankabut): 18]. … I am to give warning plainly and
      publicly [Al Quran 38 (Sura Sad): 70]. … I am but a warner, open and
      clear [Al Quran 46 (Sura Al Ahqaf): 9]. … I am from Him a warner to you,
      clear and open [Al Quran 51 (Sura Az Zariyat): 51]. … I am a plain
      warner [Al Quran 67 (Sura Al Mulk): 26]. Prophet Muhammad (saws) used to
      repeat his words thrice so that the same were fully understood (R.S. 696).
      Al Quran states: … Make your utterance straightforward [Al Quran 33 (Sura
      Al Ahzab): 70].<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>

      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">The objective of the media along with
      other sections of the society should be to establish peace, stability and
      fraternity and not to encourage conflict and hatred. Al Quran states: …
      Make peace and reconciliation … [Al Quran 49 (Sura Al Hujurat): 10].
      Prophet (saws) said: Do not create hatred (R.S. 637).<o:p>
      </o:p>
      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">The objective of the journalists should
      be to advice and warn and not to create <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">fitna-fasad</i>,
      mischief and rebellion. Al Quran states: Allah commands justice, the doing
      of good … He forbids all indecent deeds and evil and rebellion … [Al
      Quran 16 (Surat Al Nahl): 90]. Holy Quran states: Let there be no
      compulsion in religion. Truth stands out clear from error … [Al Quran 2
      (Surat Al Baqarah): 256]. Al Quran states: … Commit no excesses in your
      religion … [Al Quran 4 (Surat An Nisa): 171]. In another verse Al Quran
      states … Exceed not in your religion the bonds of what is proper,
      trespassing beyond the truth … [Al Quran 5 (Surat Al Maida): 77].<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>According to the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">fuqaha</i>,
      the Muslim jurists’ excess here means that truth is sometimes concealed
      or trampled upon, to exceed limit while supporting or assisting any matter
      or to interpret in the light of superstitious ideas and beliefs. Prophet
      Muhammad (saws) said: People who exaggerated are ruined (R.S. 1736). Al
      Quran states: We send the messengers only to give good news and to warn
      … [Al Quran 6 (Surat Al Anam): 48]. The mission of the Prophet (saws) is
      to convey the truth. Holy Quran states: … I am only a warner [Al Quran
      27 (Sura An Naml): 92]. In another verse Al Quran states: … I am but a
      warner and a bringer of glad tidings … [Al Quran 7 (Surat Al Araf):
      188]. Al Quran addressing the Prophet (saws) states: We have truly sent
      thee as a witness, as a bringer of glad tidings and as a warner [Al Quran
      48 (Sura Al Fath): 8]. The Messenger’s duty is but to proclaim the
      message … [Al Quran 5 (Surat Al Maida): 99]. … And Allah sent
      messengers with glad tidings and warnings … [Al Quran 2 (Surat Al
      Baqarah): 213]. Messengers who gave good news as well as warnings… [Al
      Quran 4 (Surat An Nisa): 165]. … Verily I am sent unto you from Him to
      warn and to bring glad tidings [Al Quran 11 (Surat Hud): 2]. … But thou
      art truly a warner and to every people a guide [Al Quran 13 (Surat Al Rad):
      7]. … And We sent thee but to give glad tidings and to warn [Al Quran 17
      (Surat Bani Israil): 105]. We only send the messengers to give glad
      tidings and to give warnings … [Al Quran 18 (Surat Al Kahf): 56]. But
      thee We only sent to give glad tidings and warnings [Al Quran 25 (Sura Al
      Furqan): 56]. … I am only a warner [Al Quran 27 (Sura An Naml): 92]. …
      Truly We have sent thee as a witness, a bearer of glad tidings and a
      warner [Al Quran 33 (Sura Al Ahzab): 45]. Thou art no other than a warner
      [Al Quran 35 (Sura Fatir): 23].<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Verily
      We have sent thee with truth, as a bearer of glad tidings and as a warner
      … [Al Quran 35 (Sura Fatir): 24] … Truly am I a warner … [Al Quran
      38 (Sura Sad): 65].<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span><o:p>
      </o:p>
      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">The responsibility of the Prophet
      (saws) is not to force. Al Quran states: … Not mine is the
      responsibility for arranging your affairs [Al Quran 6 (Surat Al Anam): 66.
      … And I am not set over you to arrange your affairs [Al Quran 10 (Surat
      Yunus): 108]. … Thy duty is to make the message reach them. It is Our
      part to call them to account [Al Quran 13 (Surat Al Rad): 40]. … And
      thou art not one to compel them by force …[Al Quran 50 (Sura Qaf): 45].
      Thou art not one to manage their affairs [Al Quran 88 (Sura Al Gashiya):
      22]. This means that the responsibility of the Prophet (saws) was not to
      force or compel people to accept guidance but to explain clearly all the
      implications and consequences of not following the truth. The journalists
      while discharging their duties should bear this in mind and try to follow
      this principle. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">The
      journalists while reporting should be meticulous for conveying true and
      accurate information. There is no room for error or speculation in the
      absence of conclusive proof and must avoid half-truths for the journalists
      are accountable to Almighty Allah for his deeds. As regards false
      allegation Al Quran states: … Produce your proof if you are truthful [Al
      Quran 2 (Surat Al Baqarah): 111].<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Holy
      Quran states: Why did not bring … witnesses to prove it. When they have
      not brought the witnesses, such men in the sight of Allah stand forth
      themselves as liars [Al Quran 24 (Sura An Nur): 13]. In another verse Al
      Quran states: … If a wicked person comes to you with any news, ascertain
      the truth, lest you harm people unwittingly and afterwards become full of
      repentance for what you have done [Al Quran 49 (Sura Al Hujurat): 6]. Al
      Quran states: When there comes to them some matter touching public safety
      or fear, they divulge it. If they had only referred it to the Messenger or
      to those charged with authority among them, the proper investigators would
      have known it from them direct… [Al Quran 4 (Surat An Nisa): 83].
      Referring the matter ‘to those charged with authority’ in the
      journalistic profession would usually mean that when a matter concerning
      public safety, national security or such other important matter comes up,
      the junior in the profession should consult the senior in the profession
      or those more informed in the matter and more qualified to give opinion
      such as editor, executive editor, news editor etc. Holy Quran states:
      Those who witness no falsehood and if they pass by futility, they pass by
      it with honourable avoidance [Al Quran 25 (Sura Al Furqan): 72]. The
      teaching of this verse is not to give evidence to false and not to assist
      anything, which implies fraud or falsehood. The condemnation is not
      restricted to positive falsehood or of being mixed up with things implying
      falsehood; but futilities- vain random talk, un-edifying jokes, useless
      show etc. - are all condemned. Holy Prophet (saws) said: It is sufficient
      to make a man liar when he goes on circulating without verification all
      that he has heard (R. S. 1547). The proper course for the journalists is
      to cross check information for not becoming the victim of wicked source.
      Al Quran states: … Never can surmise take the place of truth [Al Quran
      53 (Sura An Najm): 28].<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;

      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Mass media under Islam can be fruitful
      and legitimate only if it works for those higher objectives and purposes
      for which Muslims are required to live for. Al Quran states: You are the
      best of peoples evolved for mankind enjoining what is right, forbidding
      what is wrong … [Al Quran 3 (Surat Al Imran): 110]. Holy Quran states:
      … We have made of you an ummah justly balanced that you might be
      witnesses over the nations … [Al Quran 2 (Surat Al Baqarah): 143]. Al
      Quran states: … You be witnesses for mankind … [Al Quran 22 (Sura Al
      Hajj): 78]. In another verse Al Quran states: … That you might lead
      mankind out of the depths of darkness into light … [Al Quran 14 (Surat
      Ibrahim): 1]. Holy Quran explaining the responsibility of the Messenger
      (saws) states: … That he may lead forth … from the depths of darkness
      into light … [Al Quran 65 (Sura At Talaq): 11]. It is therefore
      naturally expected that the journalists must work to realize the higher
      objectives of the Creator.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">In fact the journalists are the
      communicators of the message and media is the most powerful means of
      moulding public opinion and winning hearts. The journalists should
      therefore be careful while using pen. Al Quran states: Invite all to the
      way of thy Lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching and argue with them in
      ways that are best and most gracious … [Al Quran 16 (Surat Al Nahl):
      125]. In another verse Al Quran addressing the Prophet (saws) states: And
      by the Mercy of Allah, you dealt with them gently. And had you been severe
      and harsh-hearted, they would have broken away from about you …<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>[Al Quran 3 (Surat Al Imran): 159]. Al Quran states: And speak …
      mildly …[Al Quran 20 (Sura Ta-Ha): 44]. Al Quran states: And of those
      whom We have created, there is a community who guides others with the
      truth and establishes justice therewith [Al Quran 7 (Surat Al Araf): 181].<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>In another verse Al Quran states: Those who love to see scandal
      circulate (i.e. published and broadcast) among the believers will have a
      grievous penalty in this life and in the Hereafter … [Al Quran 24 (Sura
      An Nur): 19].<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Holy Quran states: … Come not near to indecent deeds,
      whether open or secret … [Al Quran 6 (Surat Al Anam): 151]. Al Quran
      states: … The things that my Lord has indeed forbidden are indecent
      deeds, whether open or secret; sins and trespasses against truth or reason
      … [Al Quran 7 (Surat Al Araf): 33]. In another verse Al Quran states:
      Woe to every kind of scandalmonger and backbiter [Al Quran 104 (Sura Al
      Humaza): 1]. Holy Quran states: And be moderate in thy pace and lower thy
      voice for the harshest of sounds without doubt is the braying of the ass
      [Al Quran 31 (Sura Luqman): 19].<o:p>
      </o:p>
      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Freedom to investigate facts so as to
      formulate and express opinion is essential. This helps a journalist to
      fulfill his or her responsibility or duty to ascertain the truth, speak
      out against injustice and actively support and establish what is good. Al
      Quran states: And what is the wrong with you that you fight not in the
      Cause of Allah and for those weak, ill-treated and oppressed among men,
      women and children whose cry is: Our Lord, rescue us from this town whose
      people are oppressors and raise for us from Thee one who will protect and
      raise for us from Thee one who will help [Al Quran 4 (Surat An Nisa): 75].<o:p>
      </o:p>
      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">But this freedom is subject to certain
      limit and must not unnecessarily create sensationalism and expose the
      mistakes and shortcomings of others without good, valid and justifiable
      reason. Prophet Muhammad (saws) said: One who covers up the failings of
      somebody in this world will have his shortcomings covered by Allah on the
      Day of Judgement (R.S. 240). On another occasion Prophet (saws) said:
      Every one of my followers will be forgiven except those who make public
      the faults of other people (R. S. 241). Al Quran states: Those who avoid
      great sins and indecent deeds, save lesser offences, verily thy Lord is
      ample in forgiveness … [Al Quran 53 (Sura An Najm): 32].<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Al Quran states: O you who believe
      avoid suspicion as much as possible for suspicion in some cases is a sin.
      And spy not on each other, nor speak ill of each other behind their backs
      …<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>[Al Quran 49 (Sura Al
      Hujurat): 12]. From this verse it is clear that conjecture is not
      forbidden as such. What is not permitted is to follow every kind of
      conjecture. It means one should not entertain suspicion in respect of a
      person without any valid ground and reason. The teaching of the Holy Quran
      is not that one should refrain from conjecture or suspicion altogether but
      what is enjoined is that one should refrain from much and not required
      suspicion. The last limit of lawful conjecture is that one should conduct
      oneself cautiously in order to ward off any possible mischief from him. It
      is not right to take an action against an individual only on the basis of
      a conjecture. It is necessary to investigate before forming an opinion and
      be sure that there are sound and valid reasons for the conjecture and
      whether the conduct one is adopting on the basis of the conjecture is
      permissible. The general principle of Islam is not to be engaged in such
      activities as finding fault, shortcoming, mistake, defect and weakness of
      others. From the conduct and behaviour of a person or persons if some
      signs of corruption are visible and there is apprehension that he is about
      to commit a crime, the government including the journalist can enquire
      into his or her affairs. Attack on the honour and dignity of people
      unjustly and unnecessarily is not permitted in Islam. Holy Prophet (saws)
      said: The worst excess is to attack the honour of a Muslim unjustly (Sunan
      Abu Dawud). This tradition of the Holy Prophet (saws) implies that if
      criticism is made for valid reason and justly then it is permissible.
      Basically backbiting or <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">gibat </i>is not allowed in Islam except in case it is needed for a real
      and genuine necessity and the necessity may not be satisfied without
      having resorted to it. The <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">fuqaha</i>,
      Islamic jurists and scholars are of opinion that the general principle of
      backbiting or <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">gibat</i> however does
      not stop the oppressed from raising his or her voice against the oppressor
      before such person who, he thinks, can do something positive to stop such
      oppression, persecution and injustice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>In Islam it is allowed to make public the wrong doings and mistakes
      of any individual or group with the intention of reform and warn people of
      the mischief of person or persons so that they may ward off the evil and
      its negative impact. To raise voice publicly against person or persons who
      are engaged in spreading sin, immorality and corrupting people’s faith
      is permissible in Islam.<o:p>

      public utterance of hurtful speech except by one who has been wronged …<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>[Al Quran 4 (Surat An Nisa): 148]. According to Islamic legal
      principle, in practicing the right of criticism a line should be drawn
      between criticizing the ordinary man and criticizing one in public office.
      In the later case, a distinction should be made between their public
      activities and their personal life. The ethical values of Islam that
      secure privacy and forbid any violation of personal rights should be
      observed. Groundless or avoidable allegations without any justification
      cannot be tolerated, and slander and libel are forbidden (Fathi Osman.
      Muslim World: Issues and Challenges. p107. Islamic Center of Southern
      California, Los Angeles, C.A. 1989.). <o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">The basic objective of Islam is the
      general welfare of mankind and not any particular group. The journalists
      like other sections of the society should therefore work for the welfare
      of the people by way of promoting benefit and preventing harm. God’s
      purpose is but to promote and foster welfare and prevent corruption in the
      earth. Al Quran states: We have not sent you but as a mercy for all
      creatures [Al Quran 21 (Sura Al Anbiyaa): 107]. God never intends to
      impose hardship upon people. Al Quran states: … Allah does not wish to
      place you in difficulty … [Al Quran 5 (Surat Al Maida): 6]. The general
      objective, nay the essence of the Islamic teaching is to work for public
      good. This very precept is an integral part of the fundamental belief of
      Islam. But while working for public interest it must be understood that
      the benefits must not confine to a person or a group of persons rather the
      efforts should be for yielding benefit to the largest possible number of
      people. Leading Islamic scholars are in agreement in principle that all
      efforts to promote public interest, which does not go against the
      objective of the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">shariah</i>, are
      allowed nay encouraged by Islam. In Islam it is not permitted to invite
      people towards <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">asabiah</i>. Prophet
      Muhammad (saws) said: One who invites people towards <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">asabiah</i>
      is not my follower (Sahih Muslim, Kitabul Imarat, Bab Ujubi Mulajamati
      Jamaat Al Muslimeen and Sunan Abu Dawud, Kitabul Adab, Bab Fil Asabiah).
      Asabiah is group feeling, which obviously believes on the superiority of a
      particular group over the other, hatred of one group towards the other,
      supporting a particular group even if it commits wrong against another
      group which is following a right and just course. In Islam people must
      work to promote public interest and not group interest if such activities
      go against the general welfare. Working to promote group interest however
      allowed only when such activities in no way go against the public
      interest. The journalists while working for the social interest should
      keep this principle of Islam upper most in their mind.<o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">To sum up, Allah has sent <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Rusul</i> or Messengers (aws) to communicate to humankind what He has
      revealed. In fact the Prophets (aws) were the best communicators. It is
      interesting to note that the journalists are communicators not only of the
      present day situation and past historical events but like other sections
      of the society should shoulder the responsibility of the Prophet (saws)
      who is no longer among us in conveying truth and opposing evil, wrong,
      oppression and injustice. It behoves that journalist should work and live
      for this natural expectation and should in no circumstance take part in
      slander, mischief and should exercise utmost restrain, for the cause of
      truth and justice can be best served by those who act cool-headedly and
      should take appropriate steps for the well-being of mankind after due
      consideration rather than under the influence of impulse and emotion. <o:p>
