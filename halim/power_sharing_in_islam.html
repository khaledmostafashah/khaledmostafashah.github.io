      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">In the backdrop of the
      parliamentary election held in Bangladesh and the formation of the
      government in which<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"> </i>Jamaat-e-Islami
      has joined, a question is often raised in different circles whether it is
      permissible for an Islamic party to join in a coalition government in
      which the policy of the major component party does not genuinely reflect
      its commitment to Islam. The issue needs to be critically examined and
      addressed to satisfy the inquisitive minds of the workers of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">dawah,</i>
      nay the workers of the Islamic movement.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">It is very important for
      the workers of Islamic movement to have clear and sound understanding of
      the objective and purpose of the Islamic movement, nay the duty and
      responsibility of the Islamic leadership as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">khalifa,</i>
      representative of Allah swt on the earth. The prime responsibility of the
      Islamic leadership is to enjoin what is right <u>(</u><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">maruf</i>) and forbid what is evil (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">munker</i>).
      Al Quran states: You are the best of peoples, evolved for mankind,
      enjoining what is right, forbidding what is wrong [Al Quran-3 (Al-i-Imran):
      110]. And this can be fulfilled, in to day’s context, in the most
      effective manner if the Islamic leadership can utilize state machinery and
      can successfully make use of the tax money paid by the vast majority of
      the Muslims deeply committed to Islam and who sincerely wish the victory
      of Islam, not only in Bangladesh, but also elsewhere in the world. Such
      commitment of the people of Bangladesh was truly reflected when crisis
      developed in different hot spots of the world, as now in Afghanistan. The
      people of Bangladesh also expressed in the past their solidarity with
      their brethren in Palestine, Kashmir, Bosnia, Kosova and Chechnya.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Now the question is how to
      implement the wishes and desires of the Muslims of Bangladesh to fashion
      their lives in accordance with the precepts and teachings of Islam. Should
      we wait for indefinite period for resurgence of Islam, nay the landslide
      victory of the Islamic movement with two-thirds majority in the
      parliament, which alone shall not be sufficient unless backed by 88
      percent or so Muslim votes? We have in Bangladesh 12 percent minority.
      Experience has shown that Jamaat, the oldest Islamic party in the region,
      could not come to the power <u>during the</u> <u>60 years of its existence</u>.
      Should we wait and wait and wait or be pragmatic and realistic and
      participate in coalition government to implement the Islamic agenda, even
      if partial, to forward the cause of the vast majority people and
      ameliorate the sufferings of the common masses from anarchy, corruption,
      nepotism and cronyism of the ruling elite left by the colonial imperialist
      powers in the newly independent Muslim countries to rule in absentia
      through their agents.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">We need to examine the
      issue of participation by the Islamic political parties in a coalition
      government having other partners with semi secular agenda strictly keeping
      in our view the Islamic history and divine <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">shairah</i>
      (law), the sacred texts and not the human interpretation and jurisprudence
      of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">ijtihad </i>based on these texts
      which cannot have the sanctity of fundamental texts.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Now if we look to the
      basic principle of Islamic law, the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">shariah</i>-
      the sacred texts of the revealed Holy Quran and authentic<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal"> sunnah</i> of the Prophet (saws) then it becomes clear to us that what
      practices and methods are not prohibited and forbidden (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">haram</i>) in Islam are lawful (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">halal</i>)
      under the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">shariah</i>, the Islamic
      law. For a detailed discussion on the subject the readers may refer to Dr.
      Yusuf Al Qaradawi’s, (eminent Islamic scholar of Egypt and Dean of the
      Faculty of Shariah, Qatar University) book The Lawful And The Prohibited
      In Islam (American Trust Publications. 10900 W. Washington Street.
      Indianapolis. IN 46231 USA. Also available in website www. qaradawi.net/english/main).
      It can therefore be safely affirmed that since participation by the
      Muslims in government, which does not strictly follow Islam, is not
      included in the prohibition list, the involvement of Muslim organizations
      and parties in the coalition government having partners who are not
      committed to implement Islam but at the same time also not antagonistic,
      hostile and opposed to Islam are permitted or lawful in Islam.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">If we look back at the
      history we will find examples that will bear testimony that participation
      in government which is not strictly Islamic is permissible both for
      individual Muslims and groups for achieving good and avoid evil. In this
      connection reference may be made that Prophet Yusuf (aws) participated the
      government of Pharaoh to rescue the famine and drought stricken people.
      Prophet Yusuf (aws) did not hesitate to join the pagan government of
      Pharaoh and he did not make it a condition that the non-believers have to
      accept <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">tawheed </i>(monotheism)
      before he takes charge of government to administer the food management.
      Prophet Yusuf (aws) accepted the ministerial responsibility for he thought
      it was his human responsibility to ameliorate the suffering of the people.
      It means that if Islamic leadership have any expertise they are bound even
      today to offer their services to the ruling government for the common good
      (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">maslahah)</i> and social welfare
      and refusing to give such service shall tantamount to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">zulm,</i> oppression. Prophet Yusuf (aws) therefore did not hesitate to
      participate in the administration of Pharaoh to save people from
      starvation. The same principle should hold good and valid even now. What
      has happened to Prophet Yusuf (aws) can repeat to Muslims of our time. In
      such circumstances, Muslims are permitted to participate in the
      non-Islamic government to fulfill the greater interest of the Muslim
      community, the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">ummah </i>and prevent evil and wrongdoing. Failure to do so will lead to
      undermining the overall interest of the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">ummah
      </i>and allowing the evils to spread and dominate the society.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The other example is that
      of the Negus, the Emperor of Abyssinia, what is now known as Ethiopia, who
      became Muslim in the hands of immigrated Muslims when Prophet Muhammad
      (saws) was alive. Negus embraced Islam but he did not declare <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">shariah</i> the basis of his government nor he took any step to
      implement Islamic law for that would have threatened his Kingdom and
      endangered the lives of the immigrant Muslim guests. From this it becomes
      clear that Muslims can rule without implementing the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">shariah</i>,
      if the circumstances are not at all in their favour or the people are not
      yet ready for such reform or the situation is not healthy enough or
      conducive for such transformation and change. That Emperor Negus was a
      Muslim is proved from the fact that Prophet (saws) offered <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">salatul
      janaja</i> when the death of Negus reached him.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Commenting on this Ibn
      Taymiyyah said: “We know definitely that he could not implement the law
      of the Quran in his community because his people would not have permitted
      him to do. Despite that, the Negus and all those who are similar to him
      found their way to the pleasure of Allah in eternity although they could
      not abide by the laws of Islam, and could only rule using that which could
      be implemented in the given circumstances” (Ibn Taymiyyh. Al Fatawa
      19/218-219).</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Another example is that of
      Omar bin Abdul Aziz, the fifth rightly guided Caliph, who could not
      abolish kingship although he did not like and approve monarchy because of
      the absence of consultative (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">shura</i>)
      system as a right of the Muslim community, the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">ummah
      </i>and continued to remain king. Nevertheless he took important steps and
      managed to bring about major changes and reforms in the society and
      eliminate many <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">munkar</i>, bad and
      evil practices and restored <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">adal</i>
      and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">ihsan</i>, justice and fairness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>By accepting to rule under monarchy, which he did not endorse, he
      was able to do many <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">maruf</i>, good
      things, and no Muslim historian ever claimed that he was wrong and
      misguided in his actions.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The community of believers
      may participate in an alliance aimed at preventing injustice and
      oppression, at serving the interest of humankind and at protecting human
      rights. The faithful can pursue all these noble objectives even with those
      who do not share the same faith and ideology. This is established by the
      endorsement by Prophet Muhammad (saws) of the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">hilf
      al fudul</i>, an agreement signed by the pre-Islamic Arab tribes to
      protect their rightful mutual interest. The agreements signed by the
      Prophet (saws) with different tribes before and after the conquest of
      Makkah including the treaty of Hudaibiyya are ample testimony that the
      Islamic leadership can always cooperate with the non-Muslim rulers not to
      speak of half-hearted Muslim rulers in matters of common good and rightful
      cause. The Madina Charter is an important document that makes it clear
      that cooperation between divergent ideological communities is essential
      for establishing peace and tranquility in the society which can create
      congenial atmosphere for the onward march and progress of the Muslim <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">ummah</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">A government, though not
      strictly Islamic, is considered very close to Islamic one if it
      establishes justice, because justice is the most important element of the
      Islamic government, and it is said that justice is the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">sunnah,</i>
      the law of Allah. Imam Ibn Taymiyyah is reported to have said: “God
      upholds the just state even if it is unbelieving, but does not uphold the
      unjust state even if it is believing”.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">maqasid al-shariah</i>, the goals of Islam include everything that is
      needed to realize <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">falah</i>, human
      well-being and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">hayat tayyibah</i>,
      good life within the constraints of the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">shariah</i>.
      Al-Gazali pointed out: “The very objective of the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">shariah</i> is to promote the welfare of the people, which lies in
      safeguarding their faith, their life, their intellect, their posterity and
      their wealth. Whatever ensures the safeguarding these five serves public
      interest and is desirable” (Al-Mustafa (1937) vol. 1. pp. 139-140.

      was sent down by Allah swt only for achieving benefits of humans in
      earthly life and the Hereafter, in the known ranks of these interests: <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">al
      daruriyyah</i> (the indispensable), <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">al
      hajiyyah</i> (the needful) and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">al
      tahsiniyyah</i> (the dignifying). Dr. Yusuf Al Qaradawi emphasized on the
      profound need of understanding and establishing <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">fiqh</i>
      of balances (principle of balances), the balancing of interest and effects
      so as to determine which should be given precedence and which should be
      discarded, balancing evils against each other in the same way of balancing
      interests so as to determine which could be accepted and which has be
      avoided, balancing interests against evils if they contradict, so as to
      determine when to give the avoidance of evil a precedence over the gaining
      of interests, and when to<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>forgive
      evil for the sake of interests.<o:p>

      loss. Also in cases of conflicting interests, temporary interest is
      forsaken in favour of long-term or permanent interest; superficial
      interest is neglected for the sake of real interest, and sure interest is
      given precedence over uncertain interest.<o:p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-weight:normal">If

      A temporary evil should be forgiven for the sake of realizing long-term or

      elimination would lead to a greater evil. However in normal conditions,
      the avoidance of evil should come before the realization of interest.<o:p>

      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-weight:normal">Dr.
      Yusuf Al Qaradawi then raised the question whether an alliance with
      non-Muslim forces acceptable or reconciliation with governments that do
      not adhere to Islam acceptable or is it allowed participating in the
      ruling regime that is not purely Islamic and operates under a constitution
      that has loopholes or does not have full approval of Islam. He advocated
      that the structure of politics should be built on <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">fiqh
      </i>of balances (principle of balances). Here he referred that Dr. Hassan
      Al Turabi joined the Socialist Union of Sudan and had accepted
      appointments under Jafar Nimeiri’s regime even before he announced the
      application of Islamic <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">shariah</i> in Sudan to choose lesser evil and avoid the greater evil
      (Dr. Yusuf Al Qaradawi. Priorities Of The Islamic Movement In The Coming
      Phase. pp 33-38. Dar Al Nashr, Cairo. Also available in website www.

      <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-weight:normal">Imam
      Ibn Taymiyyah gave a very strong opinion on the permissibility of assuming
      some public offices in an unjust state if the occupant of such office
      would seek to alleviate some of the injustice or curb evil and corruption
      (Ibid. p 41). <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Some leading Islamic
      scholars of the subcontinent are of the view that Islamic movement should
      not cooperate or join in the government with political parties having
      halfhearted commitment towards Islam. But the majority of the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">ulama</i>
      and eminent Islamic scholars worldwide do not share such a view. In fact
      many Islamic parties and organizations worldwide have participated with
      other political groups for achieving common objectives, prevent evil and
      to serve the greater interest of the community within a non-Islamic
      framework. Even Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan participated in the government
      under the military ruler Gen. Zai-ul-Huq. With due respect to the scholars
      who believe that truly Islamic parties should not cooperate with secular
      parties, non-Islamic or with halfhearted commitment to Islam, it can be
      safely pointed out that such an extreme view is not corroborated and
      supported by <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">shariah</i> and definitely permissible and lawful as such cooperation,
      alliance and teamwork is intended to equip the Islamic leadership with the
      ability to react positively in difficult situations when the interest of
      the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">ummah </i>needs to be protected.
      The intention of the Islamic <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">shariah
      </i>is to make life-path easy and convenient and not one of hardship and
      inconvenience. Allah swt in His infinite mercy and wisdom has advised
      Muslims not to make situation difficult and opt for easy option. Al Quran
      states: “… Allah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make
      things difficult for you…” [Al Quran 2 (Surat Al Baqarah): 185.
      Translated by Dr.Muhammad Muhsin Khan and Dr. Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali].
      Another commentator of the Holy Quran translated the verse as: “…
      Allah desires ease for you, and He does not desire hardship for you…”.
      In another verse Al Quran states: “… He … has imposed no
      difficulties on you in religion …” [Al Quran 22 (Surat Al Hajj): 78].
      In another verse Al Quran further states: “… Allah does not want to
      place you in difficulty…” [Al Quran 5 (Surat Al Maidah): 6].<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prophet Muhammad (saws) said: “… God did not send
      me to be harsh, or cause harm, but He sent me to teach and make things
      easy” (Sahih Muslim: 3506). Ibn Abbas reported that Messenger of Allah
      (saws) said: “Teach and make things easy and not difficult …”.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Now let us discuss the
      issue of Muslim cooperation with non-Muslims from rational point of view.
      In India, the Muslims are big a minority. What can they do to protect
      their interest since there is no hope of forming an Islamic government in
      near future? The best option for such minorities is to share power and
      enter into alliance and coalition with democratic political parties that
      shall protect human rights, defend their life and properties and guarantee
      the freedom of expression and belief.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Some Muslim countries are
      ruled by military dictatorship hostile to Islam. Sheikh Rashid Ghannoushi,
      an eminent Islamic scholar of Tunisia, is of opinion that in such
      circumstance Islamic parties should cooperate with democratic and secular
      forces to topple the dictatorship that would respect fundamental human
      rights and liberty and will create favourable environment for the working
      of the Islamic movement.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The establishment of
      Islamic government is the ultimate long-term objective of all Islamic
      movements in the world. There is no bar in forming alliance with any group
      for common purpose the objective of which is to ensure human welfare (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">maslahah</i>), benevolence <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(ihsan)</i>
      and justice <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(adl).</i> Islamic
      leadership should always be ready to extend their helping hand to
      democratic forces particularly when such groups commit not to frame laws
      repugnant to Islam. Islamic leadership and organizations should be
      pragmatic enough to form alliance with democratic forces not totally
      committed to implement Islam as a stop-gap and short-term arrangement to
      push the cause of Islam, even if partially, for that shall make sure the
      ultimate victory of Islam.</td>
