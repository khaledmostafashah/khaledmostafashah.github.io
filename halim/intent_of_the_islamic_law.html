    <td width="100%">
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">The New Nation published my article 
      captioned ‘Islam and Democracy: How Far Compatible’ on 11 March 2006 
      wherein I referred to the Ijtihad of Caliph Omar concerning his decree by 
      which he&nbsp; suspended the amputation of hands of the thief and he decreed 
      that this law couldn’t be implemented if people are without food and they 
      steal. Caliph Omar took this decision because of the famine condition in 
      Arabia and his apprehension that people may be tempted to steal due to 
      scarcity of food and starvation. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">In that article I raised the 
      question as to what will happen if we expound this law of Caliph Omar in 
      case of adultery? Can we implement Islamic Penal Law for adultery as long 
      as we keep the door of obscenity open such as brothels, bars, obscene 
      movies, obscene printed books and pornography or the government cannot 
      ensure the marriage at appropriate age? Or if we cannot make adequate 
      arrangements for housing so that our troops can stay in the barracks with 
      their wives and truck and bus drivers are not required to remain isolated 
      from their spouses for days and months.&nbsp; Really what moral authority we 
      have to demand implementation of Hudud before creating congenial and 
      healthy social environment?&nbsp; Only recently Tariq Ramadan, distinguished 
      educator of Philosophy at the University Fribourg, Switzerland and an 
      eminent Arab Islamic scholar, has given a clarion call for the suspension 
      of Hudud for the time being, till all relevant issues have been examined 
      by the scholars</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Some readers of this article raised 
      question as to why I write on such sensitive issues where there is Iktilaf, 
      difference of opinion among the Islamic scholars. My immediate reaction to 
      such opinion holders was that we must address all issues and try to 
      resolve those. There is no meaning of keeping problems beneath the carpet. 
      I thought that we need to enlighten people on the intents of the Shariah 
      so that unnecessary doubts are not created in the peoples’ mind.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Later while reading the Bangla 
      translation of the book of the eminent Egyptian Islamic scholar and Dean 
      of the Faculty of Shariah, Qatar University Prof. Dr. Yusuf Al Qaradawi 
      ‘Shariatul Islam Khuluduha Wa Salahuha Lit-tatbiki Fi Kulli Jamanin Wa 
      Makan I found that he holds almost the same view as I do. Prof. Dr. Yusuf 
      Al Qaradawi opined that before implementation Hud, punishment for adultery 
      we have to establish an [ideal] Islamic society [Bengali tr. Islami 
      Shariater Bastobayan, Oddhai- Bartaman Juga Islami Shariat Bastobayaner 
      Purba Sharta, Khairun Prokashani, Dhaka, 2002, pp 174-179]. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Now the question that arises what 
      prompted Caliph Omar to suspend the amputation of the hands of thief in 
      case of food crisis? What is the rationale, raison d'être behind? Again 
      what impelled Prof. Dr. Yusuf Al Qaradawi to conclude that in our time we 
      cannot implement Hadd, punishment for adultery, unless we are able to 
      create an ideal Islamic society and close the door of obscenity [ibid. pp 
      174-179]. What is the underlying principle, justification behind this 
      ruling?</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">There is no meaning of concluding 
      that Muslims of this generation do not have the ability or are not 
      competent to exercise Ijtihad for then we have to believe the current 
      generation of Muslims are not vicegerent of Almighty Allah to establish 
      His Will which is not a fact for Allah ordained: It is He Who has made you 
      (His) agents, inheritors (Caliph) on the earth [Al Quran 6: 165]. From 
      this verse of the Holy Quran it is clear that the door of Ijtihad should 
      remain open rather than be restricted to a particular generation, person 
      or age. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Every generation has right to 
      understand the revelation in its own way, even if it differs from that of 
      previous generations. Any Muslim is entitled to contemplate on a revealed 
      statement and draw conclusions that his or her reason allows, provided the 
      utmost intellectual capability has been used. A scholar may change his 
      views, as happened with Imam Shafi, whose move from Iraq to Egypt resulted 
      in new views. One ruling may rescind an earlier one, elaborate on a 
      concise statement, narrow the scope of a more general concept, or restrict 
      an absolute injunction. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Muslims’ contemporary situations 
      and circumstances are not the same as those prevailing at the time of 
      revelation. Understanding the intent depends on understanding those 
      traditions and customs –asbab al nuzul- of the time of the revelation. 
      Changing situations demands different understandings to accomplish the 
      timeless intent. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">The divine intent could easily be 
      identified depending on whether or not text itself is conclusive and 
      whether the intent is stated explicitly or implicitly &nbsp;As to the thief, 
      male or female, cut off his or her hands; a punishment by way of example 
      from Allah for their crime [Al Quran 5: 38]. This statement includes an 
      order to cut off the hands of thieves in order to realize the divine 
      purpose of protecting property - the relevant verse is understood as 
      ordaining the penalty in the light of prevailing situation at the time of 
      revelation. Protecting property is a timeless intent, but cutting of hands 
      of thieves to actualize the intent was linked to prevailing situation at a 
      time of revelation. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">No doubt the divine intent is most 
      important but the question is how the revealed statement may be confined 
      to particular circumstances. The intent is also more important as 
      revelation was sent down to actualize them, while the methods set forth by 
      revelation are just example and models </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Revealed statements were not sent 
      down once for all, imposed from the divine upon all peoples, but rather 
      are a set of solutions to problems occurring at any time. Many solutions 
      were changed by virtue of human experience. Moreover many solutions were 
      not given in revelation but rather were suggested by individuals and 
      Muslim community, then endorsed and sanctioned by revelation.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Revelation based legislation was 
      based on the actualities of life. Sources of legislation aimed at 
      rationalizing life. The Shariah accommodated life in the past and advanced 
      it, our life today has yet to be accommodated by a new model, the demands 
      of which are so vast that existing models fail to meet them. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">The Shariah is universal being 
      addressed to all peoples, none is discharged from its binding obligations, 
      and none is excluded for its rulings. Circumstances, situations and events 
      prevailing at the time of revelation do not affect its universality.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Changing and emerging situations 
      calls for new understanding that do not resemble those belonging to the 
      time of revelations. This approach focuses on the facts of contemporary 
      life. Therefore what was prohibited becomes permitted and vice versa on 
      the grounds that the realities of modern life necessities that divine 
      intents be actualized according to the new understanding. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Cutting off the hands of thief, the 
      divine intent behind the penalty was to deter thieves, protect property 
      and provide safety for individuals. If the implementation of such 
      punishment the benefit or advantage outweighs the disadvantage, then the 
      former is religiously intended otherwise not. While implementing any 
      divine commandment, the intent should be kept uppermost in view. This is 
      the lesson we learn from Caliph Omar’s suspension of amputation of hands 
      during famine. When applying rulings to different emerging events, the 
      divine intent must be explored to its ultimate conclusion. Due to the 
      diversity of emerging situations, successful applications depend largely 
      on identifying the rulings’ purposes. Lack of knowledge of the Shariah 
      inflicts hardships. Such people calls for mechanical implementation of the 
      Shariah.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">It is important that we need to 
      guard against the automatic application of the Shariah rulings of the 
      earlier scholars. Those who call for applying the Ijtihadi conclusions of 
      the Companions of the Prophet, Imams and Fuqaha (jurist) in our 
      contemporary situations arguing that our previous scholars excelled in 
      every respect and applied their ability to the utmost forget that applying 
      the legacy of the golden era to the contemporary life will create 
      bottleneck in the advancement of the Ummah and endanger its progress.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Our ancestors were wonderful in 
      applying religion to their lives and within their particular contexts. 
      They successfully interacted with the actualities of their lives, 
      situations and circumstances. However the lives of the contemporary 
      Muslims have greatly changed since then, and the complexity of modern life 
      is beyond our ancestors’ imagination. This calls for a correspondingly new 
      Ijtihad, one that will naturally draw upon their Ijtihadi legacy as 
      conventional wisdom. However, applying Shariah rulings to modern life 
      requires that they be built on the reality of the contemporary life.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Suspending the penalty for theft in 
      the year of famine is a well known Ijtihad by Caliph Omar. He analyzed the 
      prevailing situation and discovered that widespread famine might force 
      people to steal in order to survive. Applying the penalty for theft in 
      such a case would have been unjust. The universal inclusive ruling was 
      thus restricted in order to actualize the Shariah purpose of protecting 
      the self. This is also the objective of Prof. Dr. Yusuf Al Qaradawi when 
      he said that before implementing punishment for adultery an ideal Muslim 
      society must be created where doors of obscenity is totally closed. </p>
      <p align="justify">
      <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">However it 
      should be stressed that despite all restrictions, the conclusive nature of 
      the ruling itself is not subject to change over time. If the conditions 
      required for application exist, it should be applied and vice versa. Not 
      applying the ruling at a certain time or to a particular case does not 
      jeopardize the validity of that particular ruling. Annulling the ruling is 
      a risky approach for some people might think later that the earlier ruling 
      has been abrogated. Such an approach might cause the destruction of the 
      methodology embodied in Al Quran 6: 165 as discussed earlier.</span></td>
