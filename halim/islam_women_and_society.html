      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">The New Nation published my article 
      ‘Muslim Society: Reasons for Backwardness’ in January 2004 (interested 
      readers can read the text of the article in website
      <a href="http://www.geocities.com/sah1947" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
      <span style="text-decoration: none">www.shahfoundationbd.org</span></a>). 
      On 18 February 2005 a Bangla translation of the article appeared in a 
      local daily (interested readers can see the text of the article in website
      <a href="http://www.shahfoundationbd.org/" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
      <span style="text-decoration: none">www.shahfoundationbd.org</span></a>). 
      A learned lady raised objection to my observation that wife can receive 
      and entertain the male guest of husband in his presence as long as she 
      adheres to the Islamic standards in her dress. In that case male guest 
      will naturally see female host. In support of my view, I quoted eminent 
      Islamic scholars of our time Prof. Dr. Yusuf Al Qaradawi, Dean of the 
      Faculty of Shariah, Qatar Islamic University and Dr. Hassan Turabi, 
      eminent jurist and ideologue of Sudanese Islamic movement. These eminent 
      scholars quoted Hadith Bukhari, Hadith Muslim and Muwatta Imam Malik in 
      support of their opinion [Prof. Dr. Yusuf Al Qaradawi, The Lawful and the 
      Prohibited in Islam, American Trust Publications, Indianapolis, U.S.A., pp 
      168-169; Dr. Hassan Turabi, Women in Islam &amp; Muslim Society, Milestones 
      Publishers, U.K., 1963, p 123 and Jeffery Lang, Even Angles Ask, amana 
      publications, Maryland, U.S.A., p115]. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">The other objection raised by the 
      learned lady was my observation that the Saudi women use veil, they cover 
      their face, but other scholars of Islam view that such veiling or the 
      covering of the face destroys women’s personality, even some think that 
      veiling is harmful because it impairs women’s vision. It is also harmful 
      for it creates obstacle in expression and hindrance to breadth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">In that article, I emphasized the 
      importance of female participation in the mosque for the advancement of 
      the Muslim society and commented that barring women from the main prayer 
      space is not Islamic, they more aptly reflect the age of ignorance or 
      jahiliyah. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">I am raising all these issues once 
      again after so many days because situation in Bangladesh after the writing 
      of my article in 2004 has not improved much and I am rather pained by 
      certain development in this regard.&nbsp; It seems some people are not prepared 
      to listen anything new even if it is consistent with the teachings of 
      Islam for some people in our society believe that our earlier scholars 
      have explored all the gems of the Quran and Hadith and the new generation 
      has nothing to add. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Recently my friend Mohammad Ashraf 
      Husain, editor of literary monthly Notun Safar, narrated me that he along 
      with his wife and daughters were out in Dhaka city and it was time for 
      Asar prayer. Brother Ashraf prayed Asar in the mosque while his wife and 
      daughters waited in the street until he came back after he offered his 
      prayer as women are not welcomed in the mosque. Mrs. Afroz Anjum is 
      holding a Ph. D in literature. She and the girls could offer Asar prayer 
      after returning home and that was too late and they had to offer Asar 
      Kadha. Who is responsible for their being late in Asar prayer? Is not 
      denying women access to the mosque a jahiliyah practice? During the time 
      of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) women prayed in the 
      mosque and they were not segregated in watertight compartments.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">I shall now narrate another incident. 
      Recently, I have been in a post marriage reception party in Dhaka city 
      along with my wife, a professor of economics in a government college in 
      Dhaka city. The bridegroom is a barrister settled in London and the bride 
      is an Australian graduate in Information Technology settled in Sidney. 
      Both bridegroom and bride are Bangladeshi by birth. In the party, sitting 
      arrangements for men and women have been separated by using curtain. The 
      entry points of the male and female sections were totally separated and 
      there was no way for a husband to communicate with his wife to depart from 
      the reception party. Those couples who had two mobile phones, one set each 
      with husband and wife, were communicating with each other so that they 
      could leave the party for home. Those couples who had no mobile telephones 
      at the both ends were finding it difficult to communicate with each other. 
      Incidentally, neither my wife nor I had any mobile telephone with us. What 
      to do? I, therefore, partially removed the screen at the entry point of 
      the female section, far off from the actual place where the ladies are 
      really sitting, to locate my wife but I met vehement opposition from a 
      minor girl of say 12-13 years, the age of my grand daughter, in decent 
      Hijab. I am currently running sixty. I think such segregation of women in 
      watertight compartment is jahiliyah, a pre–Prophetic culture of the days 
      of ignorance. Even today during Hajj a husband faces no difficulty in 
      moving with wife or faces no resistance from other women while trying to 
      locate his wife as happened in this post marriage reception.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Some people over emphasize Hijab, 
      sometimes even give more emphasis than Iman, faith. It is, in my view, 
      quite wrong to use the first outward and visible sign of a Muslim woman, 
      the Hijab, as a clear indicator of whether she is a good or a bad Muslim. 
      Some people also seem to take the view that for women’s dress, the black 
      the better- if she is in black from head to toe she must be highly 
      righteous. If she wears socks too she must be even more pious and 
      virtuous. On the other hand, if she wears western clothes she must be a 
      very bad Muslim. This is very simplistic analysis. It does not take into 
      account the family background from which she has come. It may be that 
      nobody in her family circle ever wore Hijab. It does not take into account 
      the most important factor as to where she spent fourteen years, the age 
      when nearly everyone is influenced, while studying in secondary and higher 
      secondary levels before entering the university for higher education. It 
      did not take into consideration the fact that she studied in English 
      medium schools where western dress is a common phenomenon. Girls in such 
      educational institutions wore jeans and T-shirts. It does not take into 
      account the strong influence of the media, the advertisement business and 
      the youth culture, which might have dominated her thinking throughout 
      adolescence. It does not take into consideration the fact that in some 
      parts of the world – and not only in non-Muslim countries- a woman in 
      Hijab would find it difficult or impossible to get a job or even a place 
      in a higher educational institution. All these factors and several others 
      affect a Muslim girl’s attitude to dress now a day. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Can we really say that all such women 
      and girls are bad Muslims? From my own experience of knowing Muslim women 
      from many parts of the world (I have worked in the U. N. as international 
      civil servant), I have observed that some who dress decently, but do not 
      wear anything resembling Hijab, could have a greater love of Allah, a 
      greater devotion to prayers and a greater degree of sympathy and kindness 
      to their fellow human beings than many who wear complete Hijab but have 
      some other defects which, because they are not visible, may not be really 
      noticed. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">We should not, therefore, judge and 
      identify women by their outer appearances only but welcome all Muslim 
      women to the Islamic gatherings without conditions of dress, and without 
      constantly questioning and harassing them about it. It is our duty to 
      ensure that every Muslim woman is aware of the requirements of Islamic 
      dress, the reasons for it and their importance. We should also encourage 
      her to obey the dress code of Islam, using the Islamic principle of Hikmah, 
      wisdom and patience. It also helps if we can make available modern styles 
      of dress that the ordinary woman finds acceptable which also comply with 
      Islamic principles. Ultimately she must make her own decision. We have to 
      understand that every human being is on a journey and passes through 
      different stages of spiritual and intellectual development. If we want 
      such women to come close to mainstream Muslim society and learn more about 
      Islam, we have to be very cautious in our approach and understand their 
      mental makeup as are now. If we reject them or show disrespect to them or 
      show signs of looking down on them, they are likely to avoid us even 
      revolt. That would be a loss to them and to the Ummah. We have to 
      encourage those in full-Hijab and those in semi-Hijab and those not in 
      Hijab. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">As said earlier, some people over 
      emphasize Hijab, sometimes even give more emphasis than Iman, faith and 
      insist that women not in Hijab should not be invited or allowed to attend 
      Islamic programs and social gatherings. This is against the principle of 
      Dawah, Islamic call and guidance nay the preaching of Islam &nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">But why should we bother people and 
      make a fuss about Hijab. There are a number of other things about which 
      people are negligent. Even in the matter of dress, it is prescribed in the 
      Hadith for Muslim men to cover themselves in public from navel to knee. 
      Yet Muslim boys and young men come out for sports in brief shorts (for 
      example while playing football) that do not reach even half way down the 
      thigh. No one says such young men are violating the principles of Islam 
      and should not attend Islamic activities. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Moreover, those young boys playing 
      football wearing brief shorts are directly exposed to millions of viewers 
      &nbsp;in the play ground in addition to television spectators than beauty 
      contestants or fashion girls for the later although exposed to television 
      viewers are not directly exposed to millions of &nbsp;viewers in the stage as 
      in the case of former. But this is hardly discussed.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Then again, girls attending English 
      medium schools wearing T-shirt or trouser are severely criticized for 
      exposure of their breasts, but young boys wearing skin tight pants 
      exposing their testis are not at all censured although in this case boys 
      deserve equal condemnation like girls. It seems society is more tolerant 
      towards the wrongdoings of boys than girls.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">I am not saying that one wrongdoing 
      justifies another wrongdoing. What I am trying to point out is that just 
      as the young men are not conscious of violating the Islamic code of dress 
      by wearing brief shorts and skin tight pants, so is the Muslims girls 
      unconsciously got to used to inadequate dressing mainly during their time 
      in secondary and higher secondary educational institutions. There is no 
      reason to be severe with women yet lenient with men. There is no room for 
      double standard in Islam.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Finally, as regards full-Hijab, I 
      would like to quote the opinion of Sheikh Adil Salahi, an eminent Arab 
      Islamic scholar who is the Director of Islamic Foundation UK, English 
      translator of Sayyid Qutb’s monumental commentary of the Quran- ‘Fi Zilal 
      al Quran’- ‘In the Shade of the Quran’ and author of another 850 page 
      mammoth work ‘Muhammad: Man and Prophet’. Commenting on the verse 24 (Sura 
      An Nur): 30-31 wherein both men and women have been asked to lower their 
      look when fall on the opposite sex Sheikh Adil Salahi in his regular 
      weekly column ‘Our Dialogue’ in Saudi daily Arab News wrote: </p>
      <p align="justify">
      <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">The 
      instruction of the verses quoted above is that both men and women are 
      required to keep their eye cast down, so that when they meet each other, 
      neither should men stare at women nor women at men. The natural question 
      that arises is why man should lower his gaze if the face of woman is 
      totally covered? From the text of the verses it is clearly evident that 
      the face of the woman is not to be covered and, therefore, man has been 
      advised to lower his look.</span></td>
