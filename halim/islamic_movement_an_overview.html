      <p style="text-align:justify">To some people it looks
      strange why Islamic leadership is not in power in Bangladesh and other
      parts of the Muslim world even after working for several decades to bring
      about the required social change. The reasons are many and every Muslim
      country has its own idiosyncrasy and peculiarity. It is generally true
      that leadership of the Islamic movements has not been able to properly use
      their vast manpower, the workers of <i>dawah, </i>call and<i> </i>guidance.
      There is also no doubt that Muslim leaders have failed to take a realistic
      and pragmatic assessment of the existing scenario and draw a well
      thought-out action plan to solve the critical ills of the life of the <i>ummah.</i>
      Islamic movements have not done enough work to train their manpower to
      meet the challenge of the age and are busy with what the Indonesian Vice
      president of the World Bank Ismail Serageldin has described: “As the
      world explores the marvels of genes, breaks down the secrets of the atom,
      reaches to the stars, and calculates the age of the oldest rocks, we
      Muslims… debate whether a woman’s nail polish prevents her from making
      full ablutions”. Ismail Serageldin expressed his dismay over the
      discussion on such minor issues as to “whether it is Islamic to have
      golden teeth or to give the Quran to a non-believer, or whether it is
      permitted to study Western law” in the Islamic columns of prominent
      Saudi Arabian newspapers like Arab News, Saudi Gazette and Riyadh Daily.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">It is also largely true
      that Islamic leadership took a very negative attitude towards public good
      and social welfare of the common masses and has failed to earn the trust
      and confidence of the people. Sheikh Rashid Ghannoushi while commenting on
      the objective of the Islamic movements remarked: “Islamic movements
      should not make their primary goal to assume power in the government.
      Taking over the government does not necessarily mean the biggest
      achievement of the struggle. The bigger success would be when the society
      loves Islam and respect its leaders… As Islamic movement, we must be
      critical in assessing our strategies. Our activities and efforts must be
      reviewed in order to be relevant with the current changes… Islamic
      activists must prepare themselves with the correct knowledge and relevant
      skill so that they will be able to apply wisdom in carrying out effective
      and efficient <i>dawah</i> activities”. Malaysian Islamic Party leader
      Abdul-Hadi Awang rightly pointed out: “Politics of Islam is the politics
      of <i>dawah,</i> of winning hearts and minds of the people more than
      getting votes. It is based on fundamental truths, not ephemeral interests.
      That’s how Islam has been winning people all through history”.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The leadership of
      the Islamic movement is bent on shifting the failures to others. Dr.
      Farish A Noor, Malaysian academician and human rights activists has
      rightly pointed out: “One cannot continue to blame ‘foreign agents’
      and ‘international power brokers’ for the loss of one’s credibility
      at home. The real problem that beset the economy and political system stem
      from cronyism, corruption, abuse of power and lack of accountability and
      transparency in the government”.</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">The most important reason
      that the workers of the Islamic movement or the workers of <i>dawah</i>
      are poorly equipped and not well trained is that they are not up-to-date
      of the latest developments in the field of knowledge. They are not aware
      about the most recent <i>ijtihad</i>, whatever little research is being
      done by the eminent Muslim scholars in various fields throughout the
      world. The leadership of the Islamic movement is mostly happy with the
      past heritage. Self-glorification for the past achievement and success has
      blinded Muslim leadership to the need to examine their history in a
      critical and analytical manner with a view to exploring the points of
      weakness. In actual fact the Muslim legacy is not adequate enough to
      provide solutions of our contemporary crisis. Islamic movements still
      measure themselves by the past models and ignore time and distinctive
      features, and yet expect identical results. The right perspective and
      perception needs to be invoked. In this way, a fair interaction with the
      past can be made instead of vainly trying to revive it. The study
      materials for the workers of the Islamic movements do not empower them
      with sufficient knowledge and ideas for meeting the changing needs of the
      age. The <i>dawah</i> workers, the cadres of the Islamic movement, are
      forced to read substandard books as rightly pointed out by<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Dr. Pervez Hoodbhoy, Professor of Physics, Quaid-e-Azam University,
      Islamabad, Pakistan. He said: “In fact many individuals make huge
      profits by producing substandard and badly written books filled with
      conceptual, pedagogical, and printing mistakes”. Shoddy books are
      included in the compulsory study materials of the <i>dawah</i> workers of
      the Islamic movement for the financial benefit in terms of royalty<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>of the so-called elite writers of the Islamic movement.
      Consequently Islamic workers have lost sight of the comprehensive totality
      of the Quran and thus losing the opportunity to relate to reality and
      control the inevitable changes in time and circumstances as the Quran
      behooves Islamic workers to do. The Muslim leadership rather is now
      behaving in a way that circumstance dictates their thinking. Muslim
      leadership is not the master of the circumstance rather circumstances
      dictate them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">The most regrettable
      affair of the today’s Islamic movement is that its elite leaders have
      developed weakness for wealth and money. To put in the language of
      Malaysian academician Dr.Chandra Muzaffar: “The love of money has given
      birth to the religion of moneytheism … The worship of wealth, and the
      worship of power and prestige it generates, have become so pervasive that
      we can perhaps talk of moneytheism as a formidable challenge to
      monotheism. Moneytheism, the ideology which legitimizes the relentless
      pursuit of riches is an end in itself.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">It has been argued that
      certain contemporary approaches to religion which eulogies wealth without
      an iota of concern for social justice are nothing more than conduits for
      the propagation of moneytheism. Moneytheism contradicts the essence of
      faith in a variety of ways. One, the blind worship of money often leads to
      the displacement of God in one’s worldview. Even if it does not, the
      pursuit of wealth for the moneytheists is at least on par with the worship
      of God. Two, since the accumulation of wealth for its own sake is a
      self-serving activity, it fosters a form of selfishness which is
      antithetical to the values which religion so cherish. Self-gratification
      becomes the overriding goal of human existence. Three, consequently
      moneytheism not only legitimizes greed but it also sanctifies
      acquisitiveness. It is in this moneytheistic civilization that greed and
      acquisitiveness have acquired legitimacy and respectability that was
      denied them in all previous epochs of human history. Four, because greed
      has become legitimate, the culture of moneytheism emphasizes acquiring
      more and more and more. That is why the entire system of economic
      production in contemporary societies is geared towards the constant
      stimulation of desires. Religion, however, is the ethic of restraint, of
      controlling and curbing one’s desires, that is regarded as worthy of
      emulation. Conspicuous consumption and a fetish enslavement of fads and
      fashions, which are defining characteristics of modern living, is totally
      alien to religion with its commitment to moderation, balance and
      equilibrium. Five, the consumption patterns and the underlying attitudes
      engendered by moneytheism have become so pervasive and penetrative that
      they threaten to transform human personality so completely that the person
      who might dominate the 21<sup>st</sup> century could well be an utterly
      self-serving individual with very little empathy and compassion for his
      fellow beings. How moneytheism, which manifests itself in almost every
      sphere of life, is changing the human personality is undoubtedly one of
      the greatest challenges confronting religion nay the Islamic movement. For
      the moulding of character has been one of the time honoured roles of
      religion, the Islamic movement.</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">Materialism or
      acquisitiveness is a new phenomenon in the Islamic movement. Allah swt has
      promised victory to the Muslim if we live and die for Islam. Al Quran
      states: ‘Never will Allah change the condition of a people until they
      change what is in themselves’ [Al Quran-13 (Surat Ar Rad): 11]. Mohammad
      Asad in his celebrated commentary of the Quran - The Message Of The Quran
      - translated this verse as: “God does not change men’s condition
      unless they change their inner selves”. Unless the leaders of the
      Islamic movement shun moneytheism and bring change in their hearts,
      pattern of behaviour and their priorities and goal of life, Allah will not
      give victory to the Islamic movement.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">The concept of an
      exclusive or one-dimensional organization, political, social, cultural or
      intellectual, has wreaked great damage to the unity of the Islamic
      movement. It has led such organization to believe that it is the
      embodiment of the will and consciousness of the Islamic movement, which
      surely is a misleading concept; one does not truly realize the
      implications of such a perception. Never can an individual organization be
      a substitute for the Islamic movement as a collective endeavour and will
      of the people. Rather such single organization or party will become mere
      splinter group on a long list of adversarial groups. The Quran and sunnah
      do not sanction the claim of sole representation of the entire Islamic
      movement by any particular Islamic organization. An organization
      persisting in its claim that it alone possesses the knowledge and
      legitimacy ends up not only alienating every other member of the Islamic
      movement but also accusing them of apostasy and ignorance. It starts with
      the wrong premise of introducing Islam to the world anew, ignoring all
      history and precedence. There exists no justification for any faction or
      individual to claim sole representation of the Islamic movement or
      monopoly of the Truth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">Some people think that
      joining a particular Islamic organization in a particular country is
      obligatory ‘otherwise you remain out of the Islamic community’, which
      is indeed a wrong perception. In this connection the comment of eminent <u>Egyptian
      </u>Islamic scholar Sheikh Adil Salahi who is the English translator of
      monumental <i>Tafsir Fi Zilal</i> <i>al Quran</i> (In The Shade of Quran)
      by Sayyid Qutub Shaheed is most relevant and noteworthy. He wrote:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">“If we interpret this
      requirement as an obligation to join a Muslim organization in the country
      where we live, then certainly we are way off the mark. There may be an
      Islamic organization in our area, which sincerely works for the
      re-establishment of Islam in our country. Its efforts certainly deserve
      support. But there can be no question of joining its being a religious
      obligation. We may have a different approach from that chosen by this
      particular organization. An individual may be of such temperament that
      membership of an organization does not suit him. He cannot be forced to
      join it. However, he should render support in any situation where he feels
      the organization is right and its attitude serves the Islamic cause.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">“Indeed, no broad-minded
      founder or leader of an Islamic organization ever suggested that his
      organization represents the Muslim community, or that its membership is
      obligatory to all Muslims. It is true that some groups advance such a
      view, but these were rigid in outlook, mistaken in approach. Imam Hassan
      Al Banna, the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood, used to say to all
      Islamically minded people: ‘Let us help one another in all matters on
      which we agree, and let us excuse one another where we differ’. This is
      the proper attitude. He never suggested that those who did not belong to
      his movement were in error, or deviated from the right path. His attitude
      was echoed by most leaders of the enlightened Islamic movements throughout
      the Muslim world. Narrow-mindedness is alien to the nature of Islam.
      Hence, to suggest that the line adopted by a particular movement is the
      only one acceptable to God is totally wrong. Since approaches may differ,
      choosing a particular approach is acceptable” (Our Dialogue. Arab News.
      11 October 1993. Jeddah).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">Eminent Iraqi scholar Dr.
      Taha Jabir al Alwani in his monograph Missing Dimensions In Contemporary
      Islamic Movements<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>has
      highlighted some of the very fundamental weakness of the Islamic
      movements:
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left:21.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list 21.0pt">1.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>The Islamic movements have become tainted with a partisan
      mentality; they have allowed themselves to turn into groups at odds with
      the higher interest of Islam. Indeed they have become incapable of
      carrying out any form of collective work within the body politic. That is
      why they have become easy targets of others to isolate or destroy them.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left:21.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list 21.0pt">2.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Some of the Islamic
      movements are confused about distinction between the sacred texts with
      human interpretation and jurisprudence of <i>ijtihad</i> based on these
      texts.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left:21.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list 21.0pt">3.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>This confusion of the divine and the human has resulted in some of
      these movements claiming that they are the sole possession of the Truth,
      thus conferring on their own human thought and <i>ijtihad</i> the sanctity
      of fundamental texts. By the same token, they have expropriated the
      historical achievements of the Muslim community as a whole and credited it
      to themselves through the claim that they are the only extension or
      embodiment of the historical reality.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left:21.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list 21.0pt">4.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Some Islamic movements have deluded themselves into believing that
      they could do without intellectual effort or <i>ijtihad </i>so long as
      they had the Quran and the Sunnah to hand. By thinking along these lines
      they have failed to link the Islamic text with the real world and lost the
      ability to actualize the faith. Some of them have indeed launched
      themselves as full-fledged organization well before determining or
      reforming the world of their thoughts. It followed that they began to
      haphazardly select notions from the real world and Muslim tradition in
      order to respond to the requirements of their organizations and everyday
      activities instead of proceeding in the light of sound and rational
      judgment.</p>
      <p style="margin-left:21.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list 21.0pt">5.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Besides their claim to encapsulate, through their ideological
      platforms, the whole faith, many of these movements have claimed to
      embody, through organization and membership- and to the exclusion of all
      other groups- the whole Muslim community. This cannot but be the result of
      intellectual immaturity and a juvenile fondness for exclusiveness and
      theatrics.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left:21.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list 21.0pt">6.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Despite their untiring verbal commitment to the Quran and the
      Sunnah, these movements have failed to draw up appropriate programmes for
      themselves, thus reflecting a poor grasp of the methodological foundations
      of Islamic doctrines and <i>Shariah</i>. Indeed methodology constitutes
      the cornerstone towards the development of comprehensive Islamic discourse
      capable of implementing the ultimate objectives of the Islamic message.</p>
      <p style="margin-left:21.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list 21.0pt">7.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Since the beginning of modern contacts with the West, the Islamic
      discourse has been marching on the spot, stranded as it were, between high
      and low tide, between progression and retrogression. At times when all-out
      mobilization of effort and resources was needed to ward off an outside
      danger, it rose to the occasion; however, during times of construction and
      development, the Islamic discourse seemed – almost everywhere-
      pathetically lacking in vigour and wholeness. Be that as it may, an
      analysis of the silent characteristics of the present Islamic discourse
      ought to instill among the Islamic activists more awareness towards
      rectifying the form and content of Islamic discourse to make it more
      viable in an age fraught with intellectual and other challenges.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Another weakness of the
      Islamic movement is that although it believes in human equality in
      principle but it has failed to translate such equality in real life
      practice in the state and society as a whole. Dr. Chandra Muzaffar rightly
      pointed out: “If one looks at the contemporary situation, one could
      argue that contemporary Islamic movements have by and large, with a few
      exceptions such as the An Nahdah Party of Sheikh Rashid Ghannouchi,
      inherited this notion of equality and political, economic, social, and
      gender relations from the history … It is a notion of equality which has
      been embodied in the <i>fiqh</i> tradition, the Islamic tradition of
      jurisprudence, which must be distinguished for the purpose of analysis
      from the divinely rooted <i>shariah.</i> It is this <i>fiqh</i> tradition,
      which has formed the basis of Islamic movement’s approach to this
      fundamental question of equality in society. What Islamic movements have
      done the most notable amongst them being the Ikhwan-al-Muslimin (Muslim
      Brotherhood) and the Jamaat-e-Islami is to say that they have accepted
      equality as an important principle at the general level. However, when it
      comes to translating that principle into specifics you will find that
      there are many inequalities and that they accept the inequality as
      divinely sanctioned…For example, in the realm of politics the <i>fiqh</i>
      oriented approach of contemporary Islamic movements is to say that you
      need a powerful ruler, a ruler who would centralize authority and thus be
      able to establish the norms and principles of an Islamic polity. That this
      in itself an act of inequality is something that does not occur to them.
      You will find that within these Islamic movements there is very little
      support for the idea of people’s participation and empowering the
      individual. Rather there exists this notion of a strong leader at the apex
      of society”.</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">Islamic movements are not
      still ready to accept and embrace women in leadership, which is another
      example of inequality between men and women. Those who object to assigning
      political position to women forget that in today’s world rulers are
      parts of an establishment. Indeed government itself is one of a group of
      institutions that share out among themselves the power and authority,
      which used to be exercised by a single ruler, regardless of the title he
      assumed. During the earlier days of Islam the <i>Kholafa-e-Rashadeen</i> <i>used
      to combine in them comprehensive and broad authority, over the whole
      Muslim world</i> which no ruler is expected to exercise in foreseeable
      future, including leading prayers, commanding armies, exercising absolute <i>ijtihad</i>
      in <i>fiqh</i>, and being the supreme judge. From the point of view of her
      competence, a woman may be assigned some of these powers, including the
      post of the head of the state, because none of these powers, including
      that of head of state, constitutes the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">overall
      <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">authority</span></i> over the community which assigns it to a woman. Dr.
      Kaukab Siddique in his book The Struggle Of The Muslim Women (American
      Society For Education And Religion, INC, U.S.A.) has discussed in depth
      and details the pros and cons of the issue and has concluded that woman
      leadership is allowed in Islam. Interested readers will find the book
      analytical and authoritative.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">To conclude, it should be
      kept in mind that in this overview an attempt has been made for a brief
      appraisal of the Islamic movement. Issues have been raised and talked
      about to initiate a wider deliberation and reflection by the <i>ulama</i>,
      academicians, scholars and Islamic activists, the workers of <i>dawah,</i>
      meaning the advocacy of Islamic order. What has been discussed here is not
      the last word, rather the subject demands in depth analysis, critical
      examination, rigorous and painstaking exercise.</td>
