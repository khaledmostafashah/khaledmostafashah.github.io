    <td width="100%"> <p style="text-align:justify">Women constitute fifty percent 
        of the population. Without the active participation of women no society 
        can make any meaningful progress, neither materially nor spiritually. 
        Our society however hardly realizes this. We therefore see that women, 
        with a few exception, are still not been allowed to enter the Masjid (mosque) 
        in Bangladesh although nobody can think of changing this morbid society 
        without the active participation of the half of its population.</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"> Women, being mothers, are the first teachers 
        to impart moral teachings to the new born babies. Unless they have access 
        to the mosque how they can learn the teachings of Islam. It is important 
        that when the general curriculum is secular, imparting no ethical values 
        to the new generation of students, we open the door of the mosque to the 
        women so that they can learn the primary teachings of Islam from the mosque 
        Imams and keep the home environment essentially close to Islam. Only the 
        vibrant Islamic families can guarantee the renaissance of Islam in the 
        days ahead and salvage Muslim societies from the onslaught of materialism 
        and consumerism. It is also important that we keep alive the age old tradition 
        of teaching the fundamentals of Islam to the children in the family in 
        view of the U.S. agenda to destroy the Islamic seminaries, the Madrasas 
        which it thinks are the breeding ground of Islamic fundamentalists, militants 
        and terrorists The reality however is that it is these centers that have 
        kept the Islamic culture alive in the society. U.S. is pressing the government 
        of Pakistan to change the curriculum of the religious schools, and urging 
        President Pervez Musharraf to divert all donations from religious seminaries 
        and at the same time asking the government of Pakistan to takeover the 
        endowment properties, the Walkf, that belongs to these institutions. U.S. 
        is also trying to influence the leadership in Bangladesh to materialize 
        its agenda. </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">Two-three years back my friend Dr. Muhammad 
        Ataul Karim, Dean, School of Engineering, City University, New York came 
        to visit Bangladesh, his home country. It so happened that Dr. Karim and 
        his daughter were at Sonargaon Hotel at the time of Maghrib prayer. Leaving 
        his daughter, Dr. Karim wanted to go to nearby Kawran Bazar mosque to 
        pray Salatul Magrib, but the daughter insisted that she will also pray 
        Magrib at that mosque. Dr. Karim fully aware of the socio-cultural and 
        religious scenario of the country went to the mosque Imam for permission 
        so that his daughter could offer Salatul Magrib at that mosque. But the 
        girl raised a very pertinent question: Why such permission shall at all 
        be needed when she can pray in any mosque in U.S. and no permission is 
        required. <br>
        Every year thousands of women of our country visit Saudi Arabia to perform 
        Umra and Hajj. They pray both at Baitullah at Makkah and Masjid An Nawabi 
        at Madina. Our women leaders, notably Begum Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina, 
        perform Umra and Hajj and our television channels broadcast these religious 
        rituals and we see them performing Umra and Hajj and praying at Masjid 
        An Nawabi. We see in the television screen ladies performing Salat in 
        the mosque during two Eid festivals in Indonesia, Malaysia, Morocco and 
        other Muslim countries, but still we do not encourage our women participation 
        in the mosque. <br>
        Why is this sorry state of affairs? Why are the ladies barred from entering 
        mosque? Is there any Shariah bar on women entering the mosque? This needs 
        in-depth study and misgiving, if any, need to be removed.</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"> If we look at Baitullah we find that even 
        today women pilgrims have complete access to this mosque and women can 
        pray wherever and whenever they like, no barriers separated the men and 
        women. In the Masjid An Nawabi built by Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings 
        be upon him) prayers were conducted in the vast empty courtyard and significantly 
        there appears to have no walls or other barriers separating men and women, 
        and there was no other partition or screen as evidence of gender segregation 
        at least at the time of noble Prophet. This will be clear if any one consults 
        the early books on the architectural design of Masjid An Nawabi, a simple 
        rectangular structure. The description of the mosques&#8217; layout and 
        the Quran indicate women&#8217;s complete access and participation. <br>
        Here in this article I shall examine the verses of the Quran and Hadiths 
        - sayings, actions and tacit approval of the Prophet, things happening 
        before him but he did not oppose- which supports women&#8217;s access 
        to the mosque and also those verses of the Quran and Hadiths which often 
        misquoted to discourage the presence of the women in the mosque.</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"> A close examination of the Quran shows and 
        depicts that some verses address man in general terms that include woman, 
        male plural which in Arabic grammar and lexicography can include women. 
        Female plural does not include men. Some verses address woman specifically 
        either by the female plural or by referring to particular woman as Hazrat 
        Marayam. </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"> Al Quran states: &#8230; you should face 
        Him only in each and every place of worship in prayers &#8230; [7(Surat 
        Al Araf):29]. In another verse Al Quran states: O children of Adam wear 
        your beautiful apparel at every time and place of prayer &#8230; [7(Surat 
        Al Araf):31]. Here in these two verses all Muslims are commanded to pray 
        at every mosque and take adornment, beautiful attire &#8211; clothing, 
        attar etc.</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"> Several verses talk negatively of those who 
        prevent believers from mosque and warn them of severe punishment as for 
        example Al Quran states: And who is more unjust than he who forbids mention 
        of God&#8217;s name from any of His houses of worship and strive for their 
        ruin although they have no right to enter them save in fear of God. For 
        them, in this world, there is ignominy in store; and for them, in life 
        to come, awesome suffering [2 (Surat Al Baqarah):114].</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"> In another verse Al Quran states: But what 
        have they now in their favor that God should not punish them- seeing that 
        they bar the believers from the Sacred Mosque, although they are not its 
        rightful guardians? None but the God-conscious can be its guardians; but 
        most of them do not know [8 (Surat Al Anfal):34].<br>
        In another verse Al Quran states: Behold, as for those who are bent on 
        denying the truth and bar others from the path of God and from the Sacred 
        Mosque which We have set up for all people alike &#8211; both those who 
        dwell there and those who come from abroad &#8211; and all who seek to 
        profane it by deliberate evildoing, all such shall We cause to taste grievous 
        suffering in life to come [22 (Surat Al Hajj):25].</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"> Al Quran in another verse states: They are 
        the ones who disbelieved and hindered you from the Sacred Mosque and the 
        sacrificial animals, detained from reaching their place of sacrifice. 
        Had there not been believing men and believing women whom you did not 
        know that you were trampling down and whose account a guilt would have 
        accrued to you without your knowledge, Allah would have allowed you to 
        force your way, but He held back your hands that He may admit to His mercy 
        whom He will. If they had been apart, We should certainly have punished 
        the unbelievers among them with a grievous punishment [48 (Surat Al Fatah):25]. 
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"> The aforementioned verses [2:114, 8:34, 22:25 
        and 48:25] indicate the right and obligation of every Muslim to participate 
        in the mosque activities. The context of these verses indicates and suggests 
        that this applies to all believers regardless of gender although participation 
        of women has not been mentioned in explicit terms in the aforementioned 
        verses.</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"> Other verses however specifically mention 
        women&#8217;s participation in group prayer. Al Quran states: The believers, 
        men and women, are protectors (Arabic word used awliya) of one another, 
        they enjoin what is just and forbid what is wrong; they perform regular 
        prayers, pay zakat and obey Allah and His Messenger. Allah will have His 
        mercy on them. Surely Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise [9 (Surat At Taubah):71]. 
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"> The above verse signifies togetherness in 
        prayers as well as in enjoining good, forbidding evil, giving charity 
        and obeying God and His Prophet. These activities clearly have a public 
        aspect to their fulfillment and are mandated for both men and women.</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"> The term awliya have different meanings: 
        helpers, allies, supporters, friends, protectors, neighbors, followers 
        or close unto one another and also used to describe relationship between 
        Ansar and Muhajirun [8 (Surat Al Anfal):72] and also relationship between 
        God and His close ones [10 (Surat Yunus):62].</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"> This responsibility of counseling (awliya) 
        is not restricted of giving advise by man to man and woman to woman but 
        also man to woman and woman to man. This responsibility has been fulfilled 
        by the woman who was present in the mosque when she opposed the fixation 
        of dower mahr by Caliph Umar ibn al Khattab while giving sermon in the 
        mosque on the ground that the Quran does not limit this [4 (Surat An Nisa):20]. 
        This incident also indicates that women were present in the mosque during 
        the time of Caliph Umar ibn al Khattab. </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"> In another verse Al Quran specifically addresses 
        Hazrat Marayam to offer prayer in congregation. Al Quran states: O Mary! 
        Worship your Lord devoutly, prostrate (Arabic word irkai) yourself and 
        bow down in prayer with those who bow down (Arabic word ar-rakiun) [3(Surat 
        Al Imran): 43]. </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">Here in this verse the term used with those 
        who bow down is ma&#8217;a al rakiin. Rakiin is the masculine plural form. 
        According to Arabic grammar and lexicography, as also mentioned earlier, 
        it may or may not include women, but must include men. The feminine plural 
        would have been rakiat, which is not used in this verse. It is thus clear 
        that Hazrat Marayam is ordered to pray with a group that includes men. 
        The words used in the verse with those who bow down- Arabic words ma&#8217;a 
        al rakiin. Rakiin is interesting. The word ma&#8217;a means with and not 
        behind or away from or segregated from. Thus it is also crystal clear 
        and established that Hazrat Marayam was asked to pray with men and not 
        behind men or away from men or segregated from men.</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"> The presence of Hazrat Marayam in the mosque 
        is further indicated in verse 3 (Surat Al Imran): 37. The word mihrab 
        used in this verse is not the prayer direction commonly used but &#8216;a 
        place of praying or private room&#8217;. [Dr. Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali 
        and Dr. Muhammad Muhsin Khan, Interpretation of the meanings of The Noble 
        Quran In the English Language, King Fahd Complex for the Printing of the 
        Holy Quran, Saudi Arabia.] That a woman is depicted as being present in 
        its inner most sanctum means that she had full access to the mosque. </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"> This verse also present Hazrat Marayam as 
        not being segregated from men, since Prophet Zakariya entered the mihrab 
        when she was there and talk to her and then offered prayer [3 (Surat Al 
        Imran): 37-39]. This clearly illustrates the position of the Quran as 
        regards the presence of women in the mosque. That Prophet Zakariya was 
        praying in the mihrab [3 (Surat Al Imran): 39], he came out of mihrab 
        [19 (Surat Marayam): 11] and Prophet Dawud was present in the mihrab [38 
        (Surat Sad): 21-22] establish that marhab was not a ladies&#8217; chamber. 
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"> The Quran testifies to the legitimacy of 
        the women&#8217;s using the mihrab and entering with men in Masjid al 
        Aqsa, the third major Muslim shrine. General and gender specific verses 
        indicate that women had full access to the mosque and that praying next 
        to men was considered normal and legitimate. The material and textual 
        sources dating to Islam&#8217;s ideal period point that women had full 
        access to the mosque. </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"> We can conclude from the aforementioned evidence 
        that material and textual records appear to support full female access 
        to the mosque during the time of Prophet, both Makkan and Madinan periods. 
        What is noteworthy is that at the two earliest and most important shrines, 
        there were no barriers separating women from men and no separate entrances. 
        Although some changes took place during the time of Caliph Umar ibn al 
        Khattab, there was however no walls or barriers separating men from women 
        within the courtyard. </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"> The first one in which partitions separating 
        men and women was introduced was al Aqsa mosque for there were three maqsurat 
        (separate enclosures or compartments shut off by wooden lattices or even 
        by balustrades) for women in 912-913, the first maqsurah probably built 
        during the early Umayyad era that was an enclosure near the mihrab that 
        separated the ruler from the people and this was disapproved by the scholars. 
        Ibn Batuta while visiting Mogadishu in later part of 1330 witness the 
        presence of such maqsurah in mosque in Mogadishu to protect rulers from 
        assassins [H.A.R. Gibb, Travels of Ibn Batuta, Bengali tr., Oitijjhya, 
        Dhaka, Bangladesh, February, 2004, pp 81-92].</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"> We shall now examine the Hadith literature 
        which is often misquoted. Eminent Islamic scholar Muhammad Nasiruddin 
        Albani in his book &#8216;Sifatu Salatin Nabie Minat Taqbire Ilat Taslim 
        Kaannaka Tarahu&#8217; quoted a Hadith from Muslim, Abu Dawud, Ibn Khojaimah 
        in which Prophet is reported to have said: A dog, an ass and a woman interrupt 
        prayer if they pass in front of the believer, interposing themselves between 
        him and the qiblah [Muhammad Nasiruddin Albani, Rasulullahr Namaj, Shatabdi 
        Prokashoni, 491/1 Moghbazar Wireless Rail Gate, Dhaka-1217, 1998, p 45]. 
        This Hadith seems to aimed at placing women behind men during prayer. 
        Hazrat Aisha, mother of the believers, however contradicted this Hadith 
        saying: You compare us now to asses and dogs. In the name of God, I have 
        seen the Prophet saying his prayers while I was there, lying on the bed 
        between him and the qiblah and in order not to disturb him, I did not 
        move [Fatima Mernissi, The Veil &amp; The Male Elite: A Feminist Interpretation 
        of Women&#8217;s Rights in Islam, Perseus Books, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 
        1991, p 70]. She criticized the lumping together of women with dogs and 
        donkeys which she regarded as insult on the person and personality of 
        women. </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"> In another Hadith the Prophet is reported 
        to have said: The better rows for men are front ones, and the worst are 
        the last ones. The better rows for women are the last ones and the worst 
        are the first ones [Al- Banna, Fath, vol.5, 6:1455. For more, see Wensinck, 
        Concordance, 3:317 quoted in Nevin Reda&#8217;s Women in the Mosque: Historical 
        Perspectives on Segregation, American Journal of Islamic Social Sciences, 
        vol. 21, no. 2, spring 2004, p 88]. This Hadith however does not clearly 
        prohibit women from the mosque and only seeks to place women behind men 
        in prayers and not intended to prevent women from praying next to men 
        in most crowded mosque. This Hadith also need to be reconciled with another 
        Hadith in which the Prophet is reported to have said: The first rows [of 
        the prayers] were perceived as superior, specially the first one, for 
        God and the angles bless the first row and the first few rows [Al-Banna, 
        Fath, vol.5, 7:1475-1480, quoted in Nevin Reda&#8217;s Women in the Mosque: 
        Historical Perspectives on Segregation, American Journal of Islamic Social 
        Sciences, vol. 21, no. 2, spring 2004, p 89]. To interpret this Hadith 
        in a way that goes against the principle of human equality as enshrined 
        by Islam cannot be acceptable for this is against the very spirit of Islam 
        and principle of natural justice of which Islam is exponent. Prophet in 
        all fairness cannot deny blessings to women keeping them in the rear rows. 
        In fact some scholars got confused and compared the best rows with the 
        prayer rows. In fact the Hadith has been explained in a misplaced context. 
        The best row is the first row of the battle. In other words, the Prophet 
        encouraged women to stay behind the lines during the battles. This becomes 
        clear if the aforementioned Hadith is read together with Quran. Al Quran 
        states: God loves those who fight in His cause in row, as if they were 
        an ordered structure [61 (Surat As Saff): 4]. The problem with this particular 
        Hadith arose as later compiler of Hadith categorized this Hadith with 
        the chapter of prayer, salat. </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"> That woman is not barred from the mosque 
        is clear from the Hadith in which Prophet is reported to have said: O 
        women. When the men prostrate themselves, then lower your gaze, so you 
        do not see the private parts of the men due to tightness of their loin 
        cloths [Al-Banna, Fath, vol.5, 6:1454, quoted in Nevin Reda&#8217;s Women 
        in the Mosque: Historical Perspectives on Segregation, American Journal 
        of Islamic Social Sciences, vol. 21, no. 2, spring 2004, p 90]. </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"> Al Fanjari cites a tradition showing that 
        a beautiful woman used to pray behind the Prophet and in front of other 
        men. [See al-Hafiz &#8216;Amad al-Din Abi al-Fida&#8217; Ismail ibn Kathir 
        al-Qurashi al-Dimashqi, Tafsir al-Quran al-Azim (Cairo: Dar Ihya al-Kutub 
        al-Arabiyah), 548-50; and al-Fanjari, Ikhtilat, 46, quoted in Nevin Reda&#8217;s 
        Women in the Mosque: Historical Perspectives on Segregation, American 
        Journal of Islamic Social Sciences, vol. 21, no. 2, spring 2004, p 88 
        ]</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"> Did any woman lead prayer in which male participated 
        in any point of history. According to Hadith Prophet had commanded Umm 
        Waraqah bint Abd Allah ibn al Harith al Ansari to lead people of her area 
        (dar) in prayer. She had her own muadhdin, and she used to lead the people 
        of her area (dar) [Al Banna, Fath, vol. 5, 3:1375, quoted in Nevin Reda&#8217;s 
        Women in the Mosque: Historical Perspectives on Segregation, American 
        Journal of Islamic Social Sciences, vol. 21, Spring 2004, no. 2, p 91]. 
        The use of muadhdin indicates that she lead prayer in which a good number 
        of Muslims were present.</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"> The aforementioned Hadith of the Prophet 
        is also recorded in the Hadith Compilation Sunan Abu Dawud which reads: 
        The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) used to visit her (Umm Waraqh 
        daughter of Abd Allah b. al-Harith) at her house. He appointed a muadhdhin 
        to call adhan for her; and he commanded her to lead the inmates of her 
        in prayer. Abd al-Rahman said: I saw her muadhdhin who was an old man. 
        On the basis of this tradition a group of scholars maintain that a woman 
        can act as imam for the people who reside with her in her house, although 
        they include males [Sunan Abu Dawud, vol. 1, Chapter 212-The Imamate of 
        Women, Hadith No. 592, note 260, English tr. by Prof. Ahmad Hasan, Al-Madina

        Both al-Tabari and Abu Thawr believed that a woman could lead both men 
        and women in prayer [Fatima Mernissi, The Forgotten Queens of Islam, University 
        of Minnesota Press, 1993, p 33 citing Ibn Rushd, Bidaya al-Mujtahid wa 
        Nihaya al-Muqtasid, Dar al-Fikr, vol.1, p 105 quoted in Women in Society: 
        Political Participation, and Women as Imam available in all the aforementioned 
        three websites]. </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"> Eminent Nigerian Islamic scholar and jurist 
        Barrister Adeleke Dirisu Ajijola commenting whether a woman can become 
        Imam wrote: &#8220;There are no priests in Islam. &#8230; there is no 
        ritual in Islam which cannot be performed by any believer of sound mind, 
        either a man or a woman, some functions, such as that of prayer leader 
        (Imam) may fall to a particular person because of knowledge, particularly 
        of the Quran, respectable, of repute or age but could be performed by 
        anyone, male or female with required qualification. &#8230; Therefore, 
        during the Prophet&#8217;s time, women prayed in the mosque. They were 
        not separated from men by any screen or curtain in the mosque; they did 
        not wear veils although they were dressed decently &#8230; In fact, they 
        have acted as Imams while men followed them in prayers&#8221; [The Concept 
        of Family in Islam, Chapter 3- Can a Woman Become an Imam? Adam Publishers 
        &amp; Distributors, New Delhi, 2002, pp 227-230].</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"> In Islam women could be confined to home 
        only as a measure of punishment if the charge of fornication is proved 
        by four witnesses [4(Surat An Nisa):15]. This verse of the Quran need 
        to be read together with saying of the Prophet: Do not stop Allah&#8217;s 
        women slaves from going to Allah&#8217;s mosques [Sahih Al Bukhari, Vol. 
        2, Book of Jumua- XIII, Chapter 11, Hadith No. 23, Dar Al Arabia, Beirut, 
        p 10]. Because of this tradition of the Prophet, Caliph Umar ibn al Khattab, 
        despite personal dislike of his wife going to mosque, refused to prohibit 
        her from going to the mosque and she continued to attend prayer in the 
        mosque. </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"> I shall conclude the article narrating the 
        prayer arrangement in one of the mosque in Toledo, Ohio, U.S. in which 
        &#8220;the main prayer is conducted with women and men praying together 
        separated by a three-foot partition that runs through the centre of the 
        hall. The women therefore do not pray behind the men but along with them&#8221;

        Washington, DC), Islam Under Siege, polity, U.K. in association with Blackwell 
        Publishing Ltd., 2003, p136]. It would be appropriate to mention here 
        that in China women have independent mosque [Book Reviews, Dru C. Gladney,
