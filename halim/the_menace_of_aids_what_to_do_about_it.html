      <p class="MsoBodyText" style="line-height:150%">Will the modern 
      civilization perish like Qaum-e-Lut, the nation of Prophet Lut (peace be 
      upon him) or it will be able to salvage itself from the curse of HIV/AIDS? 
      This poses a big question for according to WHO there is no country in the 
      world that is completely out of danger of the explosion of HIV/AIDS.<sup>1&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </sup></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" style="line-height:150%">Worldwide AIDS has already 
      killed 20 million people.<sup>2 </sup>More than 3.1 million people alone 
      have died in 2005 from AIDS. HIV infected almost 5 million people globally 
      in 2005 taking the number living with the virus to a record 40.3 million<sup>3</sup> 
      According to UNAIDS, HIV in the world attacks everyday 1400 male and 
      female. <sup>4 </sup>Newsweek in an article reported that the fastest 
      growing HIV/AIDS rates in the world are in Russia, Ukraine and Estonia.<sup>5
      </sup>&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">Africa is 
      the heart of the problem and South Africa is the epicenter where the 
      number of affected persons is 5.3 million. According to UN estimates 
      people who live with HIV/AIDS is 25 million in sub-Saharan Africa and 8.2 
      million in Asia.<sup>6</sup> 1500 dies in Asia everyday. <sup>7 </sup>&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">Massive 
      prevalence of HIV/AIDS is observed in our neighboring countries including 
      India, Myanmar, Nepal, China, Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">China 
      says it has 840,000 HIV/AIDS patients. With the disease having spread to 
      all the provinces of China, according to UN some 10 million could be 
      infected in China by 2010. <sup>8</sup>&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" style="line-height:150%">According to Indian Health 
      Ministry source the total number of people having HIV-positive is 5.13 
      million i.e. officially Indian infection rate is 0.91 percent of the 
      population. With this number of cases of HIV, India can become another 
      Africa. <sup>9</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; India has the second-highest number of HIV/AIDS 
      patients after South Africa. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">This 
      being the world scenario, we must ponder how vulnerable Bangladesh is in 
      view of the situation prevailing particularly in our neighborhood. What 
      measures we must then take to secure our country from this menace? </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">The 
      current ABC approach to contain AIDS (abstain, be faithful and use condom) 
      has not proved very successful throughout the world. It is not enough that 
      we talk occasionally about this deadly disease, but should launch an all 
      out national campaign of prevention and education. Firm political will is 
      needed to fight the epidemic. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">Ninety 
      five percent of all the people in the world who are HIV-positive don’t 
      know it.<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; The media and the civil society, side by side with 
      the government, have great role to play to create public awareness. If 
      fight against HIV’s sees success in East African countries like Bahamas 
      why we in Bangladesh shall not be able to contain it before it takes a 
      epidemic form? <sup>11</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">In 
      Bangladesh, according to the statistics provided by Ministry of Health and 
      Family Welfare about 1500 people are living with HIV/AIDS.<sup>12</sup><b>
      </b>In December 2004 a total of 465 persons are found HIV-positive, while 
      44 died of AIDS so far. <sup>13</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; However, according to the survey 
      of WHO, UNAIDS, FHI the number of people infected by HIV virus is 7500 in 
      Bangladesh and the rate of infection is below one per cent.<sup>14</sup> 
      AIDS infected persons in Bangladesh are mainly from launch, truck and bus 
      drivers (total numbering 250,000) and the helpers, rickshaw pullers (total 
      numbering 1.5 million), prostitutes of brothels and those using hotels and 
      rest houses, drug users and persons frequently traveling abroad for 
      business and other purposes. Illegal use of dispensable syringe and blood 
      transfusion without HIV tests are greatly responsible for the spread of 
      this deadly disease. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" style="line-height:150%">It is high time that the 
      government of Bangladesh takes effective measures to control, if not 
      eradicate, this disease. It appears from the deliberations of Life, a NGO, 
      that about 45 percent school teachers in capital Dhaka have no clear 
      knowledge about HIV/AIDS. Similarly, about 48 percent students and 54 
      percent guardians are totally ignorant of the nature of and antidote to 
      the fatal disease. According to Life survey 49.2 percent teachers believe 
      that AIDS is curable, 69.5 percent think HIV can be infected<b> </b>
      through touches, 50 percent denied blood transfusion as an important cause 
      of HIV virus diffusion. Around 53 percent teachers thought that AIDS 
      patients should be kept isolated. About 57 percent guardians believe that 
      AIDS is curable, 61 percent think that blood transfusion is not the cause 
      of HIV infection. <sup>15</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" style="line-height:150%">We must use the age-old 
      traditional instruments like Jarigan, side by side with radio, television 
      and print media, to create public awareness. More seminars and workshops 
      should also be organized throughout the country both at public and private 
      levels to raise the peoples understanding about HIV/AIDS. Textbooks should 
      also be used to disseminate information as to the cause and effect of 
      HIV/AIDS on individuals and the society. Moral and ethical learning and 
      persuasion can play a great role to rectify and improve current state of 
      affairs. Islamic scholars, mosque Imams and ulama should speak about the 
      causes and effects of HIV/AIDS in the religious sermons. More emphasis 
      should be given for imparting moral and ethical values, and education at 
      all levels should contain texts emphasizing superiority of moral values 
      and purity of family life. The government should also encourage marriage 
      at appropriate age so that human natural desire and instinct can be 
      channelized in lawful manner, which is possible when government can widen 
      the base of employment opportunities and eradicate poverty. This is 
      possible only when the government takes serious interest in implementing 
      the goals of Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). The government and 
      the NGOs should also construct low cost housing facilities in all major 
      towns and cities of the country particularly in the industrial belts so 
      that married couple can live together. All the means by which AIDS is 
      transmitted – drug abuse, sexual promiscuity and homosexual acts – are 
      forbidden in Islam and therefore people should not experiment with sex at 
      all until they are married and avoid drugs completely. Not sharing needles 
      is not enough. Don’t take drugs at all should be the national slogan.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">Last but 
      not the least, we have reasons to be concerned about the spread of 
      HIV/AIDS in India, which is our next-door neighbor. While, according to 
      the Indian government the figure is 5.13 million, many experts believe 
      this figure might have crossed the South African figure of 5.3 million.<sup>16</sup> 
      Some experts even put the figure at 8 million. The U.S. CIA has, however, 
      forecast the number of people with HIV/AIDS in India could touch 20 
      million by 2010. <sup>17</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;line-height:150%">This 
      being the Indian scene, Bangladesh as a neighbor has reasons to be alarmed 
      for approximately 2000 Indian truck drivers enter Bangladesh daily, in 
      addition to it is illegal entrance of Indians to Bangladesh territory. All 
      the Indian states neighboring Bangladesh are highly affected by HIV/AIDS. 
      A large number of people from Bangladesh also visit India for medical, 
      business, tourism and other purposes. </p>
      <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">It is 
      high time that the government of Bangladesh advice its consulates in India 
      to seek for proper health certificate from Indians before issuing visa. 
      Our government should install HIV/AIDS virus testing machines in all entry 
      points of Bangladesh to avert the spread of this deadly disease in 
      Bangladesh.</span></p>
