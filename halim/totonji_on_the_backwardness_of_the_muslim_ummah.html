      <span style="color:black">Dr. Ahmad Totonji, Vice President of the 
      International Institute of Islamic Thought (IIIT), </span>
      <span style="color: black">U.S.A. visited Bangladesh for three days in 
      August 2005. During the visit he addressed four select gatherings of 
      bankers, physicians, educationists and intellectuals. Earlier Dr. Totonji 
      visited Bangladesh in 1978 along with the Imam of Kaaba. The last time he 
      visited Bangladesh was in 1997. This article has been prepared based on 
      his deliberations, comments he made in open discussion forums. The article 
      also contains some remarks Dr. Totonji made in private discussion with the 
      author of this article. The draft article has therefore been forwarded to 
      him by email on 12 September 2005 for necessary editing that he returned 
      on 27 September 2005 with a little modification. The comments contained in 
      this article therefore are his own. The article is also available in 
      website

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
      <span style="color:black">Dr. Totonji, during the current visit, in his 
      speech tried to briefly identify the major reasons for the backwardness of 
      the Muslim Ummah and what should be the our response. Underlining the 
      reasons for which Muslims today are lagging behind Dr. Totonji said: “We 
      do not give much emphasis on research and development (R&amp;D) and therefore 
      we cannot formulate appropriate strategy to defend our rights and are 
      exploited by others”. He called upon the new generation “to be innovative 
      and achieve excellence; to put an extra effort whenever work demanded and 
      become the master of one’s own profession and achieve the best possible”.
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
      <span style="color:black">Dr. Totonji urged upon the mainstream Islamic 
      movement “to from Shadow Cabinet of Ministers and form <span class="grame">
      Think</span> Tanks, each Think Tank to be headed by a Minister”. “Within 
      three-four years you shall then be able to do a lot of homework in each 
      field that would enable you to formulate appropriate answer for the 
      looming national and international crisis and thereby equip yourself to 
      lead this nation. You shall then be able to mount an effective positive 
      response to the intellectual challenge posed by the <span class="grame">
      West ”</span>, he said. Dr. Totonji regretted that “we always react but do 
      not plan”. “Good ideas shall always be accepted and prevail if it is 
      presented in an articulate and coherent manner”, he said. “If we take one 
      step then the help of Allah will surely come”, Dr. Totonji said. </span>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
      <span style="color:black">Dr. Totonji emphasized the importance of 
      “delegating responsibility at every level so that new and alternative 
      leadership might emerge”. “You cannot be successful in this challenging 
      world unless you are able to produce leaders at every field”, he said. Dr. 
      Totonji underlined “the importance of utilizing the services of highly 
      skilled professionals while formulating policies”.&nbsp; </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
      <span style="color:black">He emphasized that “the new generation must read 
      the latest Islamic literature”. “It is not enough that you read Syed Qutb 
      and Mawdudi. They are eminent scholars of their time. You must read, side 
      by side with traditional literature, the latest materials that are now 
      available if you really want to face the challenge of the West”, Dr. 
      Totonji said. He underscored “the importance of learning Arabic so that 
      every Muslim can understand the message of the Quran by reading the text 
      directly”. </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
      <span style="color:black">Some Islamic movements <span class="grame">have</span> 
      “failed to make difference between local culture and Islamic culture<b>,
      </b></span>which is a reason<span style="color:black"> for the 
      backwardness of the Muslims”. “Covering face of woman is a local culture 
      and has nothing to do with Islam”, Dr. Totonji said. “Some people over 
      emphasize the importance of covering face by woman. </span>This is right 
      to those who choose it for themselves. It is not the only way in Islam.<span style="color:black"> 
      Such people do not believe that woman has a personality”, he said. Dr. 
      Totonji regretted that “some organizations are really working to create 
      bottleneck in the progress of Islam rather than its advancement”. 
      “Sometimes we suppress women and their voice is not heard. This is not 
      Islamic”, he said. </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
      <span style="color:black">“The other reason for the backwardness of the 
      Muslim Ummah is intolerance”, Dr. Totonji said. “We emphasize on points 
      where we disagree and not on points where we agree. We agree in almost 90 
      percent areas and disagree on only in 10 percent areas. But still then we 
      highlight on our differences”. “We must shun our differences”, he said. 
      “There is nothing that can be described as <i>the only <span class="grame">
      interpretation</span></i><span class="grame">,</span> there can be many 
      views and many interpretations. Islamic movement should therefore be ready 
      to allow difference of opinion, otherwise there is no chance of making 
      headway”, Dr. Totonji said. He advised dawah workers “not to mix dawah, 
      the call and guidance of Islam, with politics”. “Politics is the art of 
      possible and the strategy might be required to be changed and adjusted 
      with the changing environment”, Dr. Totonji said. He advised the workers 
      of dawah “not to ignore the minority even when they themselves are 
      majority for Islam is a religion of peace and justice and there is no 
      compulsion in religion”. </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align:justify">
      <span style="color:black">In 1997 while addressing a select gathering of 
      Islamic activists Dr. Totonji emphasized in doing things in a perfect 
      manner. “You have to achieve excellence in your performance and unless you 
      do that, you cannot expect success in this world and beat the negative 
      forces that are working against Islam and Muslim Ummah”, he said. “It is 
      not the number of people but their quality that will bring changes”, Dr. 
      Totonji said. He stressed the importance of “raising the quality of 
      manpower, the quality of those who work for dawah, Islamic call and 
      guidance”.</span></p>
