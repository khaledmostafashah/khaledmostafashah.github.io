      <p class="MsoNormal" align="center">No idea can seize a people’s soul
      unless, in some sense, it is people’s own. - Dr. Muhammad Iqbal</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Modernism is a concept that primarily
      relies on reason rather than revelation. It gained currency since the
      separation of the church and the state in the West. The socio-political
      transformation of the West due to its paradigm shift and reliance on
      democratic political system rather than on religio-political authority are
      usually taken as the distinct feature of modernity. Modernism and
      modernity are mostly used synonymously without making a clear-cut
      demarcation and are being used interchangeably. It has come to mean belief
      in science, secularism and progress. Anthony Giddens described modernity
      as ‘a Western project’. (Anthony Giddens quoted in Post Modernism
      &amp; Islam: Prediction &amp; Promise. p 7 Akbar S Ahmed. Routledge.
      London and New York). In fact until the middle of twentieth century
      Western imperialism was a vehicle for the project of modernism.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The Muslims, at least its
      major section, still being the sincere believer and adherent of the
      revealed guidance are considered as anti-modern by the West. The West
      considers that Muslims are backward, for what it says, as the Muslims
      still rely on blind imitation of the past traditions rather than
      scientific approach in analyzing and ascertaining truth. The Muslims are
      therefore largely being dubbed and stereotyped as regressive by the West.
      The West considers that Islam is against science and human equality. The
      West is particularly critical of the Muslims behaviour towards the women.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Secularization however is
      not a necessary condition for development and modernization.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>If <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">total</i> human
      development in its true form has to be achieved, moral questions cannot be
      separated. Normative values cannot be divorced from the pursuit of
      development and modernization.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Modernity
      and traditionalism are linked together in fundamental ways, even in the
      context of modernization. Religion has thus become the single most
      important variable in the explanation of social phenomena of Islamic
      countries. Scholars who have emphasized and advocated secularization as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">sine
      qua non</i> of modernization are grossly wrong. There is nothing in Islam,
      which is against development and modernization. Although societies can
      develop and modernize in material sense without any religion, the issue is
      far deeper as rightly pointed out by Jamal al din al Afghani: “Muslim
      peoples grew weak because the truth of Islam was corrupted by successive
      waves of falsity … Muslims are weak because they are not truly Muslims
      (Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age. p129. Albert Hourani. London. Oxford
      University Press. 1962.).</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Western scholars always
      advocated that modernization is possible through Westernization.
      Westernization is the only gate for developing countries to modernize.
      However a far-reaching reform of the Muslim societies is not possible
      ignoring the deep-rooted Islamic foundation of Muslim belief and cultures.
      A Muslim society’s failure in the material sphere is the proof of its
      failure in the understanding and application of the teachings of Islam.
      Such a society can hardly be described as Islamic. What is however
      required is the independent study of the Quran and the authentic <i>sunnah
      </i>as curriculum at the high school level.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The attempt by some of the
      oriental scholars often with ‘jaundiced lenses’ to brand Islamic
      revivalism as a sign of backwardness, anti-modern and anti-democratic is
      the result of their stereotype thinking for which they argue that Islam is
      not compatible with democracy. There is tendency to equate Islam with a
      political culture that is profoundly authoritarian and anti-democratic.
      Such scholars think that the nature of the Islamic ideology does not allow
      any scope where democratic values can flourish. The question is how Islam
      can be identified as against democratic norms and principles in the
      presence of <i>shura,</i> consultative institution in the form of
      parliament, cabinet and advisory body.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The scholars who allege
      such unfounded allegation that Islam is against democratic system and
      values ignore the fact that democracy could not flourish in the Muslim
      World due to foreign intervention and support to the ruling elite who are
      always stand by to serve their former colonial masters (Rethinking Middle
      East Politics: State Formation &amp; Development. Simon Bromley.
      Cambridge. Polity Press.1994). In fifties the West worked against the
      democratic aspiration of the Iran installing autocratic Shah by replacing
      democratically<u> </u>elected Mosaddeq. Still later U.S. made every effort
      to protect the Shah of Iran and defeat the Islamic revolution. The most
      recent example is Algeria where the West backed the military junta to
      nullify democratic election. American military, strategic and economic
      interests have led to the destabilization of many Islamic states. The
      focus of Western attention is oil producing Arab countries where West used
      the technique of indirect manipulation of leaders of public opinion and
      regimes to all out intervention as in the case of Suez crisis in 1956. To
      this now may be added the current situation in Iraq where U.S is trying to
      utilize exile Iraqi leaders and “supporting mercenaries” for their own
      interest. In fact there is no scope to ignore or lessen the role of
      Islamic values in the contemporary world politics that determines the
      relations between the states (Defenders of God: The Fundamental Revolt
      against the Modern Age.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Bruce
      Lawrence. San Francisco. Harper &amp; Row. 1989). There is however no room
      for generalization. Such issues must be taken seriously and not with a
      propagandist approach that attempts to construct a justification for the
      policy makers (International Terrorism: Image &amp; Reality. Noam Chomsky.
      In Alexander George edited Western State Terrorism. New York. 1991). The
      misunderstanding of Islam and branding it in different negative stereotype
      synonym is an obstacle of finding common ground on which to approach
      difficult policy issues (The United States Europe and the Middle East: An
      Uneasy Triangle. Phebe Marr. Middle East Journal 48. No. 2.1994. p 224).</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Some Western scholars
      believe that the difference in value system, dissimilarity of world vision
      and ideological differences between Islam and the West may lead to
      economic, political and cultural conflict and confrontation. Such thinking
      has led Bernard Lewis to conclude that Islamic fundamentalists pose a
      threat to Western interest (Rethinking the Middle East. Bernard Lewis.
      Foreign Affairs. 71. No. 4. 1992. pp 99-119). It is out of this fear that
      the West is actively working against all reformist movement for
      modernization, institutionalization of democracy and the genuine progress
      and development in the Muslim World.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">It is however crucial to
      critically examine such assertion that conflict of interest between Islam
      and West would turn into a threat to the world order. It is not reasonable
      to denounce and condemn Muslims action without taking into consideration
      under which circumstances Muslims were compelled to formulate such
      policies and why Muslims actions are directed against the West. The
      response of the Muslim World towards the West should rather be seen
      against the backdrop of Western attitude and behaviour towards the Muslims
      countries rather than as a threat. Muslims view themselves as victims
      rather than as threats to the world order. Muslim countries see strategic
      interest of the West as its policy of denying Muslims the right to coexist
      and pursue their interests, political, economic and cultural and their
      desire to manage their affairs without outside interference and building
      self esteemed identity and establish full control over their own market,
      wealth and resources. Whenever Muslims made attempt to be muster of their
      own situation and destiny, unfriendly quarters in the West tried to colour
      them as a threat to their interest. Such attempt of self-determination is
      a postmodern process of Islamization, a genuine effort progress and
      pluralism (Islam Globalization &amp; Postmodernity. Edited by Akbar Ahmed
      &amp; Hastings Donnan. New York. Routledge. 1994).</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Muslim modernists desire
      to reconstruct their social order on the pattern of original Islam. Indeed
      social change is the key in the modernization process. Unlike the Sufis,
      Muslim modernists and social reformers want to remold not only individual
      life but also to reconstruct socio-economic order, create a revolution in
      the life of the Muslim <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">ummah,</i>
      the Islamic community. Such modernists are committed to recast the total
      social texture for it is the social change that brings about a change in
      the attitudes and values of the largest number of common people. Indeed
      reformers like Rafaa al-Tahtawi, Jamal al-Din al-Afghani, Muhammad Abduh
      and Abdul Rahman al-Kawakibi dedicated their life to “the goal of
      renaissance (<i>nahda</i>) and modernization (<i>tajdid</i>)” of the
      Muslim society (The Challenge of Modernity. p111. Louay M. Safi.
      University Press of America. Lanham. New York. London. 1994). <u><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </u></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Muslim reformists and
      modernists true to the Islamic teaching and tradition are absolutely
      against <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">taqlid</i> or the blind
      imitation and does not subscribe to the idea that whatever our ancestors
      have done is the best that could be done and that there is nothing to add.
      The Muslim modernists have rejected <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">taqlid.
      </i>Modernist Muslim reformers and scholars are keenly aware of the need
      of deep-rooted and fundamental reformation of the Muslim society. Islam is
      a dynamic religion and it has capacity to adjust itself to aver changing
      social milieu. God in His infinite mercy and wisdom has revealed only
      outline of social laws leaving matters of detail to be worked out by
      successive generations. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Ijtihad</i>
      is a recognized legal institution of the Muslim life that enables them to
      reach newer conclusion through research and investigation to meet the
      requirement of space and time. How then Muslims can be described as
      anti-modern and opposed to scientific investigation? However modern
      intellectuals and reformers attempt to look back to the history to
      critically examine and review the decisions of the earlier generations and
      take out of that what is still relevant, valid and good for applying in
      the contemporary situation, in our life and society should not be termed
      as imitation of the past and backwardness.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Islam fundamentally
      believes in freedom of thought and freethinking and is open to debate and
      discussion. Some people are however afraid of criticism and mistook
      God’s statement in the Quran to the effect that nothing happens in this
      world unless God wishes it, that He is all powerful and human beings are
      very weak, to mean that humanity has no control over its environment and
      that things will happen naturally of their own. The purpose of such
      statements, quite clearly, was only to warn human beings of their
      powerlessness vis-à-vis God, so that people do not start thinking that
      that they are not answerable for their actions.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The real teaching of Islam
      is that we have to understand the injunctions of the Quran strictly in
      their context and background. To insist on a literal interpretation of the
      rules of the Quran, without due regard to the social change amounts to
      deliberately defeating the moral-social purposes and objectives of the
      Quran. The literal interpretation of the Quran over the past several
      centuries had done great harm to the Muslims. The Muslim reformers of the
      present time are however against such rigidity and contention.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The Muslim reformer and
      modernist present a worldview in which man, far from being the prisoner of
      blind fate firmly believes in cause and effect relationship. Muslims are
      not fatalist and therefore cannot be termed anti modern. Men are
      accountable for their actions. There is no scope for predetermination in
      Islam in so far as human actions are concerned. Mankind is the only
      exception in the creation of God for God endowed man with the capacity of
      free choice.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The West’s attempt to
      stereotype Muslims reformist movements arguing that Islam is against human
      equality and dignity is also without any foundation. On the contrary it is
      the West which has supported in the past the ‘justice of the military
      courts’ as in Egypt in which thousands lost their lives while such
      people were denied the opportunity to defend them and right to appeal.
      Egypt’s regime qualifies in Washington as the second most favoured
      tyrant after Israel (The West, not Islam, is the real enemy of democracy.
      Faisal Bodi. The Guardian. 13<sup>th</sup> January 2003).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>It is the West, which has supplied arms to the Algerian military
      junta to kill the democratic aspiration of the people of that country and
      is responsible shedding blood of the innocent civilians including the
      extra-judicial execution of women as well as men. Yet the U.S. continues
      to rearm Algerian regime (Double Standard: Dubious Morality: Duplicity in
      Fight against Terror. Robert Fisk. Independent. Quoted in The New Nation.
      7<sup>th</sup> January 2003). When the process of democratization in the
      Muslim countries as in Algeria went against the West and their loyal
      ruling elites, the process was immediately reversed. The military junta
      without trial executed several thousand Algerian Islamists, reported
      Christian Science Monitor. Thousands of Islamic intellectuals and scholars
      were imprisoned in the Sahara desert. The U.S coaxed the World Bank to
      provide a billion dollar to the Algerian junta after it had decimated the
      peaceful Islamic movement. France has been funding and arming the corrupt
      and brutal Algerian army while Britain supports the Algerian government
      and claims that it is a legitimate government. The West’s record of
      human rights is abysmal. The behaivour of the West is such that people are
      inclined to believe that fundamental right is not a prerogative of the
      Muslims. Historically, the human the Europeans referred to when they spoke
      of human rights was none but their own citizen, the French human, the
      English human or the Western human in general (Human Rights: Islamic
      Perspectives. p 231.Azzam Tamimi. Article contributed in The Quest for
      Sanity. The Muslim Council of Britain. 2002). Europeans inflicted terrible
      human wrongs, torture and oppression upon the colonized subjects. Native
      population of America and Australia were eliminated and millions of
      Africans were suppressed and enslaved.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Western colonialism in Asia, Australia, Africa and Latin America
      symbolized the most massive systematic violation of human rights ever
      known in the human history. Much of this violation involved undermining
      other people’s cultural and religious identities. The recent happenings
      in Palestine indicate that what waits for them is the same fate as the Red
      Indians. History always repeats itself, Noam Chomsky pointed out (Arabs
      and red-Indians: Brothers in fate. Yamin Zakaria. The New Nation. 5<sup>th</sup>
      July 2002).</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The record of the Western
      conduct with Afghan prisoner is regrettable. U.S failure to classify Al
      Qaeda and Taliban as prisoner of war and held them prisoner at Guantanamo
      Bay outside their homeland tantamount to committing war crimes. U.S
      decision to try the Afghan prisoner in military tribunal is a violation of
      Geneva Convention. Under article 130 of the Convention it is a serious
      crime, a grave breach, to deprive a prisoner of war of the rights of fair
      and regular trial required by the Convention and is the basis for a war
      crime prosecution. U.S even detained 105 years old Afghan Haji Faiz
      Mohammad as being the suspected Taliban or Al Qaeda, flown to Guantanamo
      Bay and afterwards released being innocent. He was allowed a shower every
      six days (A.F.P. Kabul. 30<sup>th</sup> October 2002). Amnesty
      International in a 62-page report in April 2002 has also accused U.S for
      violation of human rights of the Afghan prisoner in U.S army custody in
      Cuba and Afghanistan. 300 Afghan detainees were put in place like caged
      animal. The caged detainees suffered mental disorders from posttraumatic
      stress disorder to the early stages of schizophrenia (AP. Cuba. 27<sup>th</sup>
      April 2002).</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">After the attack of Twin
      Towers on 11<sup>th</sup> September 2001 international criticism of
      Russia’s human rights record in Caucasus faded into silence. By playing
      the war against terror card, Russia managed to sidetrack attention from
      the extra judicial killings, detentions, torture and sexual abuse. In
      October 2002 the desperate Chechen fighting for freedom took more than 800
      people hostage in Moscow theatre. To rescue the hostages Russia used
      poison gas in violation of 1925 Geneva Protocol as a result of which 115
      hostages died. Only two hostages were shot dead by the Chechen. All 50
      Chechen hostage-takers, including women, were killed in the counter
      assault (A.F.P. Moscow. 28<sup>th</sup> October 2002). The issue need to
      be addressed is what reasons are pushing Chechens towards the path of
      destruction and vengeance in which innocent will pay more than those who
      are in the wrong. The question is how do the persecuted and oppressed
      protect their rights or even their voices heard? Passive resistance would
      have no impact. The Chechens cannot win straight battles because they are
      not equally armed.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">By waving the
      anti-terrorism banner, government such as Uzbekistan seemed to feel that
      they had license to persecute dissenters, while government such as Russia,
      Israel, and China seemed to feel freer to intensify repression in
      Chechnya, the West bank, and Xinjiang, the Human Rights Watch report
      stated (AFP. Washington. 14<sup>th</sup> January 2003).</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">In fact the West’s war
      against Islam began when Napoleon invaded Egypt in 1798. Since the illegal
      creation of state of Israel in 1948 at the behest of the West particularly
      U.S and Britain, Israel continue to occupy Palestine lands and persist
      unabated the policy of apartheid and ethnic cleansing. Palestinians are
      refugees for the last 53 years and the West Bank is under Israeli
      occupation for 35 years. Today Palestinians are being denied essential
      water, most vital for humankind survival, by the Israel. To give a
      specific example in Hebron, where 600 Uzi-toting Jewish settlers live
      among 240,000 Palestinians, 85 percent of the water is diverted to the
      Jewish settlers. Palestinians have to carry coloured ID cards and drives
      cars with coloured-coded plates. Indeed a glaring example of
      discrimination. Palestinians living in isolated islands hemmed on all
      fronts by only-Jewish settlements and only-Jewish roads met the most cruel
      behaviour and humiliation at check points and roadblocks which even did
      not escape the eye of Nobel laureate South African Archbishop Desmond Tito
      when he visited Jerusalem last year. In the backdrop of the crime against
      humanity committed by Israel maintaining powerful Jewish lobby in U.S
      vis-a-vis United States silence in the face of over doings by Israel and
      arming Israel tooth and nail forced Archbishop Desmond Tito to observe:
      The apartheid South African government was very powerful, but today it no
      longer exists. Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin, Pinochet, Milosevic were all
      powerful, but in the end they bid the dust (Church Times. Quoted in New
      Nation. 30<sup>th</sup> April 2002. Apartheid in the holy Land). After the
      destruction and massacre in Jenin and Ramllah last year by the Israel army
      he made the historic prophecy that the “institution of religious
      exclusivity will crumble in Palestine and Israel like apartheid did in
      South Africa”. “An unjust Israeli government no matter how powerful
      will ultimately fall” Titu commented. He castigated U.S President Bush
      Jr. for being too soft on prime minister Ariel Sharon (Boston Globe. 14<sup>th</sup>
      April 2002). Ariel Sharon is indulging in systematic progrom and since U.S
      has proved itself principal backer of Israel by always using veto power in
      U.N.S.C, it cannot shrink its responsibility of being the abettor of the
      killing. U.S unjust backing of Israel is proved from the fact that it even
      used veto power in December 2002 to block the condemnation of Israel for
      killing U.N workers.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The West particularly U.K
      and U.S.A is silent even when Israel army is doing such heinous crime as
      using limbs of Palestinians killed (AFP. Doha. 14<sup>th</sup> January
      2002). It even bombed Palestinian television and radio stations so that
      the real picture may not reach outside world (AP. West Bank. 19<sup>th</sup>
      January 2002).</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The mental make of Israeli
      leadership can be comprehended and figured out from the statement of
      Israeli Herut Party chairman Michael Kleiner: “for every victim of ours
      there must be 1000 dead Palestinians” (How to shut up you critics with a
      single word. Robert Fisk. Independent. Quoted in the New Nation. 26<sup>th</sup>
      October 2002). In the face of such records U.S kept mum when Israel
      carried out test fire of ambitious Arrow missile (AP. Pal Machim. 6<sup>th</sup>
      January 2003).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">There is contradiction in
      the U.S policy. While the U.S branded Iraq, Iran and North Korea as the
      “axis of evil” for alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction,
      it has at the same time approved the idea of Israel building a new nuclear
      reactor. Israel posses between 100-200 nuclear and hydrogen warheads of
      all sizes and about to produce a neutron bomb according to American
      satellite picture and scientific reports (Arab News. Quoted in the New
      Nation.25<sup>th</sup> December 2002.Silence about Israel’s nuclear
      weapons. Hassan Tashin). Closing the world’s eye to Israel’s arsenal
      and weapons of mass destruction can only lead to suspicion and will be
      outright rejected by the Third World, Arab and Muslim countries.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>All weapons of mass destruction must be eliminated including those
      of the super power permanent members of U.N.S.C.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The naked nature of the
      hegemony of the United States has been exposed when President Bush Jr. in
      the aftermath of Jenin and Ramllah mass murder by the Israel army urged
      upon the Arabs and Palestinians to oust Palestine President Yasser Arafat
      and choose a new leader more acceptable to the U.S and Israel. What a
      vicious way of interfering in the internal affairs of another people
      claiming it to be the protector, promoter and defender of democracy,
      liberty, equality, freedom and human rights.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Today the West controls
      global politics through U.N Security Council. If the West desires it can
      force millions starve and die without essential medicare. The notable
      example is the blockade and economic sanction against Iraq. U.N economic
      sanctions on Baghdad since Gulf War 1990 left behind the death of 1.720
      million Iraqis during the last 12 years (AFP. Baghdad. Ist January 2003).
      Even then U.N.S.C at the behest of U.S. and U.K adopted resolution No.
      1454 in January 2003 that put further restriction on the imports by the
      Iraq. The new resolution put ban on exporting Iraq such goods as meant
      entirely for humanitarian purpose- antibiotic medicine for example. U.S
      almost forced the Security Council to adopt the resolution No.1441 to send
      arms inspectors to Iraq for alleged possession of biological and chemical
      weapons. The U.S and U.K seems to be determined to launch war against Iraq
      by passing all U.N resolutions, whether Iraq possesses weapons of mass
      destruction or not and now amassing troops in the Middle East although
      such a war will undoubtedly cause loss of many lives. The British Prime
      Minister Tony Blair has declined to promise that U.K would resort to
      military means only with U.N approval and British Foreign Secretary Jack
      Straw said that Britain reserved the right to take military action without
      a second U.N resolution (AP and Reuters. London. 14<sup>th</sup> January
      2003). U.N arms inspectors led by its Chief Hans Blix and Director of
      Vienna based International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei could
      not find any credible evidence of Iraq possessing any weapons of mass
      destruction. A.P from United Nations on 10<sup>th</sup> January 2003
      quoting U.N weapons inspectors reported that the weapons inspectors did
      not find any “smoking gun” to prove that Iraq has nuclear, chemical or
      biological weapons. In the face of U.N arms inspectors statement that they
      do not have credible evidence and repeated U.S and U.K claim of Iraqi
      involvement in weapons of mass destruction, French Foreign Minister
      Dominique de Villepin has urged upon the U.S and British governments to
      handover such proof to prove the Iraqi possession of weapons of mass
      destruction (A.F.P. Moscow). Even the U.N chief inspector Hans Blix has
      called upon the U.S and Britain to hand over any evidence it has (CIA
      Invited to search for weapons in Iraq. Ewen MacAskill, Suzanne Goldenberg
      in Washington and Richard Norton-Taylor. Quoted in the New Nation 24<sup>th</sup>
      December 2002). Disgusted over the U.S President Bush Jr. handling of the
      Iraqi issue of the possession of weapons of mass destruction the German
      Justice Minister Herta Daeubler Gemelin compared U.S. President’s
      methods to Hitler (Reuters. Berlin. 20<sup>th</sup> September 2002) and
      led Noam Chomsky to identify U.S as one of the leading terrorist of the
      world (Only Americans are afraid of Saddam Hossain out side Iraq (SchNews

      People are so frustrated that the pacifists voice against impending war on

      105 angry housewives, grandmothers and doctors between 22-83 of California
      to launch a cheeky nude peace campaign to protest President George W.
      Bush’s policy of naked aggression (AFP. Los Angels. 15<sup>th</sup>January).</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The helplessness of U.N is
      manifested from the fact that U.N has failed to take any action when the
      U.S. grabbed the Iraq’s 11,807 pages weapons declaration dossier that
      was submitted for the use of the U.N weapon inspectors. The U.S officials
      took the Iraqi declaration from the office of the Chief U.N arms
      inspector. Not all 15 members of U.N.S.C were consulted before U.S took
      the printed documents and several computer disks (AFP. United Nations. 10<sup>th</sup>
      December 2002).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Reacting to
      this event of U.S. the South African former President Nelson Mandela
      described it as an act of “piracy which must be condemned by everyone”
      (Reuters. Stellenbosch. 17<sup>th </sup>December 2002).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">In October 2001 in the
      aftermath of attack on Twin Towers U. S. government approved the Patriot
      Act that gives the government new powers to obtain personal information
      and allows the government to detain aliens deemed threats to national
      security and hold them without public acknowledgement. It has also given
      federal law enforcement agencies greater wiretap authority, access to
      student and library records and new Internet wiretap powers that in fact
      infringes civil liberties in the name of protecting liberty, safety and
      security of the American citizen. The civil right groups compare the
      Patriot Act with Alien and Sedition Act 1789, which made it illegal to
      criticize then-President John Adams. The new act clearly made distinction
      between white American and non-white U.S citizens. Using this Act U.S
      government closed the operation of notable Muslim relief agencies like
      Global Relief Foundation, Benevolence International Foundation and others
      and seized their assets without explaining the reasons for such action.
      The U.S government has also given sweeping powers and broader authority to
      F.B.I to monitor Internet sites, libraries and religious organizations.
      American Civil Liberties Union however doubted that the new measure make
      Americans safer. American Muslims are also very much suspicious of this
      Act.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">U.S even has refused to
      accept the verdict of the International Court of Justice (I.C.J)
      established under U.N Charter regarding military intervention in
      Nicaragua. U.S last year has cancelled its ratification to the I.C.J on
      the ground that U.S cannot allow the trial of American armed personnel,
      even for crime against humanity, at an international judicial tribunal. It
      is without doubt a manifest global vandalism, not the sign of a civilized
      society. Certainly it is not the expression of liberty, equality and
      freedom for which the West is so proud of.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The U.S has also formally
      pulled out from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in June 2002 with the
      President Bush Jr. determination to push ahead with a massive defense
      system The 1972 treaty served as a bedrock of the U.S-Soviet nuclear
      deterrence by essentially barring either side from building massive
      defenses, leaving each vulnerable to the other’s arsenal and therefore
      with little incentive to attack because of the likely massive retaliation.
      This the U.S did when it wants to disarm Iraq and contain North Korea.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Again U.S, the key player
      of the West, reiterated its unflinching resolve to settle all problems
      with North Korea via ‘diplomacy’ (AFP. Tokyo. 5<sup>th</sup> January
      2003) and President Bush Jr. considers Korea and Iraq ‘different’ (AFP.
      Washington. 13<sup>th</sup> December 2002) even though North Korea has
      withdrawn from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, broken all it nuclear
      agreement with U.S, put out of action the U.N monitoring equipment,
      removed seals from its nuclear facilities and thrown out all U. N.
      inspectors.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The natural question that
      arises why and how Iraq is different from North Korea? It is because Iraq
      is an Arab Muslim country rich in oil resources and if it becomes
      powerful, it might become a threat for Israel, Western vassal state in
      Middle East. To human right activists it is a big question why U.S. does
      not disarm itself which is urging North Korea and Iraq to destroy their
      weapons of mass destruction. Why not United States government does not
      comply with and enforce international efforts targeted to prohibit the
      arsenals of biological weapons it posses? Why not U.S. set example? U.S.
      quite often claim that it is responsible for the peace of the world, it
      however set a poor example by creating atmosphere of threats that has
      encouraged other countries to go nuclear.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">U.S. disregards for the
      principles of multilateral world governance and its threat that it can
      unilaterally act bypassing U.N and the U.N cannot handcuff U.S (A.P.
      Washington. 1<sup>st</sup> November 2002) has made world peace a forlorn
      hope. Behind this lie the totally undemocratic veto system in U.N.S.C that
      placed the fate of the world peace and global justice sometimes in the
      hand of one solitary nation, acting in defiance of the wishes of the vast
      majority.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The West controls global
      economy through I.M.F, the World Bank, W.T.O and the G8. The remarks made
      in this connection by Abdurrahman M. Shalghem, Libyan Secretary for
      Foreign Liaison and International Cooperation is significant. He said:
      “Terrorism has assumed many forms, resort to brutal force, the threat to
      use such force, nuclear weapons, and arms of mass destruction, as well as
      the condition imposed by the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund
      and the World Trade Organization. It is imperative that a distinction be
      made between actual terrorism and the struggle engaged in by the
      persecuted groups against their persecutors, which is seen by some as
      terrorism” (Celebrating Absolute power: And then a little hypocrisy.
      Impact International. p 7. Vol. 30. No. 10. October 2000). The I.M.F and
      the World Bank have imposed economic reform programmes but failed to
      support the poor. United States that wields substantial influence over the
      Fund and the Bank is the biggest obstacle to efforts aimed at increasing
      assistance to the most impoverished countries. The West domination of the
      world’s financial and trading systems is the dark side of globalization.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The objective of so-called
      war on terrorism is, as John Pilger puts it, to control and manage global
      economy, a euphemism for the progressive seizure of markets and resources
      by the G8 rich nations (Znet Magazine. 5<sup>th</sup> January 2002. The
      Quest for Sanity. p 62). Medea Benjamin, a former Green Party U.S. Senate
      nominee told the San Francisco Chronicle that U.S is interested in going
      to war against Iraq for oil. She charged that the U.S threatened nations
      that do not support U.N’s resolution with the loss of Iraqi oil after a
      possible military conflict with Iraq or with loss of future aid (Reuters.
      Francisco. 10<sup>th</sup> November 2002). In fact the desire of the 4
      percent population of the world to consume a greater part of the energy is
      the root cause of such war. The projection report<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>“Global Trends 2015” of the National Intelligence Council, a
      federation of intelligence agencies, predicted that “Persian Gulf oil
      will be increasingly important for world energy and industrial system but
      that the United States won’t rely on it. But it’s got to control it.
      Controlling the oil resources is more of an issue than access because
      control equals power” (Znet ibid).</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Western scholars continue
      to blame Muslims as being bloodthirsty <i>jihadiths</i> and responsible
      for initiating war and killing of innocent people. A peep into the history
      shall however negate all Western accusation and prove the innocence of the
      Muslims. In fact the number of the people killed in the hands of the
      Muslim is minimal by all standard. We shall quote encyclopedia Britannica
      in support of the justification of our claim.</p>

      The West accuses Islam of giving second-class status to women, that Muslim
      men are intolerant to their women, misogynistic, violent and cruel. This
      is so because Islam allows Muslim man to marry more then one woman. The
      Christian West failed to take note of the fact that this permission is
      given for particular situations. Islam however does not allow promiscuity
      and extra marital relation and an objective study of the Muslim society
      will establish that Muslim community worldwide is largely free from such
      relations and Muslims males are largely monogamous. This is for the fact
      that male and female population is almost equal. But if you look to any
      Western country, you will find that adultery is a common phenomenon in the
      Western society, promiscuity has become a way of life. Homosexuality is
      allowed and family as an institution is on the verge of disintegration.
      Children desert their parents and there is none in the family to look
      after the old. The Muslim society is just the opposite. How then Muslims
      can be described as anti-modern and misogynist. On the contrary it is the
      West that is abusing woman in every way. Even the Christian Church is not
      free from sex related crimes and pedophilia is a common phenomenon. The
      position of the women in the West can be comprehend from the fact that 40
      percent of the nuns in the United States have been abused by another
      priest (AFP. Washington. 6<sup>th</sup> January 2003). In U.K out of ten
      reverted Muslims seven are women (The Times. London. 7<sup>th</sup>
      January 1994.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Quoted in
      Islam: The choice of thinking women. p1. Ismail Adam Patel. Ta-Ha
      Publishers Ltd. London. 1997). The question is why the British women
      return to the fold of Islam or look back to Islam for emancipation? The
      British women convert to Islam because Muslim men are more faithful as
      husbands. Islam established equality of men and women 1400 years ago as
      far as women right to property, inheritance and right to divorce is
      concerned. Muslim Women can keep property brought with them into a
      marriage (The Venture of Islam: Conscience and History in World
      Civilization. p 342. Marshall G. S. Hodgson. University of Chicago Press.
      1974. Quoted in Freedom Modernity &amp; Islam: Towards a Creative
      Synthesis. p 163. Dr. Richard K. Khuri. Syracuse University Press. 1998).
      On the contrary Britain recognized married women’s right to own property
      only in 1857 amended in 1870, 1877 and 1882 (<a href="http://www.ac-rouen.fr/"><span style="text-decoration:none;
text-underline:none">http://www.ac-rouen.fr</span></a>. Also in <a href="http://www.netcentral.co.uk/"><span style="text-decoration:none;
text-underline:none">http://www.netcentral.co.uk</span></a>). In Britain woman
      of unblemished character were given access to their children in the event
      of separation or divorce in 1839 (<a href="http://www.ac-rouen.fr/"><span style="text-decoration:none;text-underline:none">http://www.ac-rouen.fr</span></a>)
      whereas Muslim mothers enjoyed the right of the custody of minor children
      since the advent of Islam in seventh century. In 1923 British women were
      allowed to obtain divorce on the grounds of adultery alone (<a href="http://freespace.virgin.net/"><span style="text-decoration:none;
text-underline:none">http://freespace.virgin.net</span></a>) whereas Islam
      allowed Muslim women the right to divorce some 1400 years ago. Divorce was
      first introduced in France by the Revolution and was repealed in 1816 but
      it was reintroduced in 1884 when the original legislation of 1804 utilized
      (Encyclopedia Britannica pp 926-927. Vol 22. 15<sup>th</sup> Edition.
      1986). In Italy the government despite opposition from the Roman Church
      held a referendum on the Divorce Law in May 1974 and a large majority
      favoured the law (ibid p 241). British women over 30 were allowed the
      right to vote in 1918. The same right was granted to women in U.S.A in
      1920, Spain 1932, France 1948, Italy and Switzerland between 1944-1945 (<a href="http://stabi.hs-bremerhaven.de/"><span style="text-decoration:none;text-underline:none">http://stabi.hs-bremerhaven.de</span></a>)
      whereas women in the Muslim society got the right to vote at earliest
      period of Islam while electing the Third Rightly Guided Caliph Uthman.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Western intolerance is
      reflected from its frequent attack on Prophet Muhammad (saws) To give an
      example Rev. Jerry Falwell in a 60 minutes programme with C.B.S described
      “Muhammad a terrorist, a violent man, a man of war” (AP. Washington. 4<sup>th</sup>
      October 2002). Christian intolerance showed its ugly face in Nigeria when
      Kaduna newspaper ‘This Day’ published an article by Isioma Daniel in
      which the author suggested: “Islam’s founding prophet would have
      approved the Miss World beauty pageant … What would (the prophet)
      Muhammad think? In all honesty he would probably have chosen a wife from
      among them- the contestants” (AFP. Nigeria. 22<sup>nd</sup> November
      2002). As a consequence of such irresponsible statement 200 people were
      killed in the bloody clashes. In Australia Kamal El Masri was threatened
      termination of job for taking 10 minutes to offer prayer during the
      working hours (Reuters. Sydney. 10<sup>th</sup> October 2002). The use of
      headscarf by Muslim women living in Western countries is considered a
      threat for the Western civilization and it has been always a matter of
      concern in Australia, France, Germany and some other European countries.
      What is however most amusing is that an Australia politician Reverend Fred
      Nile called for total ban on Muslim women from wearing a traditional
      head-to-knee gown in the public because that could be used to conceal
      weapons? He suggested a ban on wearing <i>chador</i> in public for it is a
      perfect disguise for terrorist as it conceals both weapons and explosives
      (Reuters. Canbera. 22<sup>nd</sup> November 2002). In Italy, Germany and
      France Oriana Fallaci’s book ‘The Rage and The Pride’ has become the
      best seller wherein the author portrayed “Islam is a religion against
      freedom, justice and democracy” and described Muslims as<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>“secretly jealous of the West”. The book also depicts that
      “Muslims multiply like rats” (French court hears call for ban on
      anti-Muslim book. The New Nation. 11<sup>th</sup> October 2002. Also in
      IslamOnline &amp; Ummahnews).</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The Western allegation
      that Islam is against science is far from true. On the contrary the Greek
      contribution to science and philosophy has been passed onto the Europe
      through the Arabs and Muslims in the form of translation from which the
      European translated those to their language. Arab and Muslim scholars like
      ibn-Rushd (philosopher, scientist and historian), al-Kindi and ibn-Khaldun
      (both founder of modern political sociology), al-Khwarizmi (mathematics
      and algebra), ar-Razi (chemistry), ibn-Sina (medicine) and al-Idris
      (geographer) made profound original contribution and passed it to the
      modern Europe. The Arab Muslim scholars, true to the faith and tradition
      of Islam, respectfully and honestly recalled the contribution of their
      predecessors, the contribution of the pre-Islamic civilization. However
      the West that translated the works of these Arab and Muslim scholars from
      Arabic to Latin intentionally forget to mention the contribution of the
      Arab and Muslims scholars. Thus the transmitter along with its culture and
      the belief that guided the transmitter has been reduced to silence, erased
      out of the peoples mind and went to oblivion. The Western Europe could now
      posses the knowledge of Hellenistic civilization because of the labour of
      the Arab thinkers. It is “the undisputable fact is that Arab and Islamic
      knowledge is at the foundation of the very rise of Western civilization
      itself” (Erskine B. Childers. Amnesia and Antagonism. Quoted in the
      article ‘Memory and Forgetting: The Erase of Islam’s Presence in the
      West’ in ‘Terrorrising the Truth: The Shaping of Contemporary Images
      of Islam and Muslims in Media - Politics and Culture’. p 41.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Just World Trust. Malaysia. 1997). Science imparts material
      knowledge. Religion teaches us the ethics of using that knowledge.
      Religion invites man to ponder over the creation and the Creator. Science
      provides the language for understanding creation and it is the creation
      that acts as the <i>ayat</i>, sign of the Creator. There is thus no
      conflict between science and religion. This has been aptly proved from the
      recent scientific research on embryology. “The information contained in
      the Quran is not only consistent with the modern scientific discoveries in
      the field of embryology but also it is a fore-runner by some fourteen
      hundred years [The Developing Human: Clinical Oriented Embryology. p viii
      a. Keith L. Moore (Professor and Chairman, Department of Anatomy,
      University of Toronto, Canada]. With Islamic Additions: Correlation
      Studies with Quran and Hadith. Abdul-Majeed Azzindani (Director, Project
      of Scientific Miracle in the Quran and Hadith, King Abdul Aziz University,
      Jeddah). Dar Al-Qiblah for Islamic Literature.1983]. The Quran is not in
      spite of its description and verification of modern scientific data, a
      treatise on science but per excellence a Book of Guidance (Al Quran 2:2).
      The Quran being the word of God must verify what science establishes
      through observation, inquiry and experiment. The research undertaken by
      Professor Moore and Azzindani proved this point without the shadow of
      doubt in one scientific area, the embryology.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Thus it is apparent that
      the allegation that Islam is against democracy, fundamental human right,
      human equality, blind imitator of the past, intolerant <i>jihadith</i>,
      misogynist and against scientific principle does not stand valid in the
      face of logic and the testimony of the recent and past history and
      therefore Islam cannot be described backward and anti-modern. On the
      contrary it is the West that in most of the time look upon the Muslims
      with coloured eye and try to stereotype Muslims by identifying them with
      all negative synonyms. One aspect of the modernism is progress and change
      and if that has to be achieved the West must change its attitude and work
      for peaceful coexistence and leave the policy of hegemony to control the
      Wealth and resources of the Muslim and Third World countries.</td>
