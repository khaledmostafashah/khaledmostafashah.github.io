      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><i>This paper identified 
      stagnation in the intellectual realm as the prime reason for the 
      backwardness of the Muslims. It made an attempt to trace the historical 
      roots, the reasons for intellectual stagnation, the rigidity of thought 
      and consequent blind imitation of the early scholars and suggested ways to 
      come out of this impasse. </i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">How the ummah, the Muslim 
      community that once ruled the waves and flourished in all branches of 
      thought declined. The ummah today shows a sharp contrast between its 
      present and its past, for just as yesterday Muslims were strong, 
      victorious and indomitable, basking in scientific progress, pioneering in 
      development and booming renaissance; today Muslims are isolated, divided, 
      weakened, and demoralized- so overwhelmed are the Muslims by a 
      debilitating feeling of powerlessness that they stand as spectator, 
      expectant but incapable of effecting any change. This chronic crisis of 
      helplessness has brought the Muslims to a point where they have degraded 
      themselves, their rights denied and their just causes defeated. 
      Consequently Muslim world today stands undeniably at a crossroad where it 
      must embark upon self-examination- a systematic, objective, balanced and 
      rational assessment of its present reality aimed at working internal 
      reform. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">The prime reason of 
      Muslims demoralized state of affairs is perhaps the stagnation in the 
      realm of thought, the decline of intellectual capacity. Why Muslims fall 
      back in the field of education? Why the Muslim community started to 
      imitate its predecessors when the earlier scholars did not imitate and 
      forbid them not to follow blindly? This is the most pertinent question in 
      this era when the Muslim reformists in every part of the world are 
      advocating for the revival of Islam. It is most important to find out the 
      reasons behind prevailing stagnation and decline. What is the cause of its 
      decline? What is the way out? </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Respect for freedom of 
      opinion was so great among the earlier scholars that they even refused to 
      record individual opinion so that such opinion might not restrict 
      succeeding generations from undertaking legal ruling (ijtihad). They 
      always encouraged formulating opinion on those areas where there was no 
      specific ruling in the Quran and sunnah - the sayings, actions and 
      endorsements of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) by way of 
      tacit approval, things happening before him but he did not oppose. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Imam Abu Hanifa (703-767) 
      applied deductive reasoning (qiyas) and exercised ijtihad, gave legal 
      ruling and felt no obligation to accept the deduction of others. He forbid 
      his students not to record his opinion since these were based on 
      analogical deduction and not thoroughly debated. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Imam Malik Ibn Anas 
      (717-801) used to apply deductive reasoning (qiyas) on matters not covered 
      by Quran, sunnah, custom and practice in Madina.&nbsp; He emphasized that he is 
      subject to error.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Imam Muhammad Ibn Idris 
      Ash Shafi (769-820), disciple of Imam Malik, was very flexible. He changed 
      many of his rulings when he went to Egypt leaving Iraq. His earlier ruling 
      which he gave, while in Iraq is recorded in the book Al Madhab Al Qadim 
      (The Old School of Thought) and his later ruling which he gave while in 
      Egypt is recorded in the book Al Madhab Al Jadid (The New School of 
      Thought). Imam Shafi changed many of his earlier opinions, which he held 
      while in Iraq because of his exposure to a completely new set of authentic 
      hadiths (the saying of the Prophet) and new environment and reality on his 
      arrival in Egypt. He pointed out that it was not possible for anyone at 
      any time to be aware of all the hadiths narrated by the Prophet or 
      remember all and were bound to commit mistake in rulings. Imam Shafi, 
      therefore, opposed blind imitation (taqlid).&nbsp; Moreover, in those days the 
      compiled books of hadiths were not as easy available as today. The 
      development of printing facilities and technological growth like Internet 
      has now made information easy accessible which was not before.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Imam Ahmad Ibn Hambal 
      (778-855) was always prepared to exercise his individual judgment and give 
      his opinion to solve any problem if no suitable answer was available in 
      the Quran and sunnah. He rejected the idea of rigid imitation of scholar’s 
      opinion and forbade his students to record any of his opinions. He called 
      upon his students not to follow his ruling blindly and those of Malik, Ash 
      Shafi, Al Awzai or Ath Thawri and others. He advised his students to take 
      or base their rulings from where others took theirs, the original sources- 
      the Quran and the sunnah.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Furthermore, the 
      Companion of Prophet (sahaba – may Allah be pleased with them) never 
      considered their ijtihad, legal ruling, as infallible truths as binding on 
      the entire Muslim ummah, but merely as opinions applicable to their 
      particular time and situation. This was the level of scholastic exercise.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Scope of research and 
      investigation allowed by Islam encouraged the scholars of the earlier 
      generations even to discuss the hypothetical problems and resolve those; 
      they even ruled that later generation should not blindly imitate them. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">History is the testimony 
      that Imam Abu Yusuf and Imam Muhammad Ibn Al Hasan differed from their 
      great teacher Imam Abu Hanifa in about one third of the rulings of their 
      Schools of Thought (madhab). Imam Muhammad Ibn Al Hasan in his commentary 
      on Muatta Imam Malik contradicted his teacher Imam Abu Hanifa in about 20 
      different rulings. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">How then the Muslims got 
      involved in factionalism and concluded that all the four madhabs namely 
      Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi and Hambali are perfect and therefore free from 
      error. It is not clear how the earlier scholars justified taqlid when 
      blind following might result in shirk, association of partners with Allah 
      for unquestioned allegiance and loyalty is only to Allah and His Prophet 
      and if Muslims do not remain conscious they are likely to mislead by 
      Satan.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Moreover it is difficult 
      to comprehend the justification of difference of opinion and disagreement 
      by a section of earlier scholars as a mercy of Allah on the Muslims ummah 
      when the Quran has emphasized the importance of unity among the rank and 
      file of the Muslims. Sectarianism is the root cause of decline of the 
      Muslim of the past and it continues to debar the growth and progress of 
      the Muslim ummah today. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Freedom of thought is 
      essential part of the Islamic legislation since the application of shariah 
      (Islamic law) at all times and places largely depends upon the ability to 
      exercise ijtihad, any loss of this vital principle bound to result in the 
      inevitable stagnation and decline of fiqh, the Islamic jurisprudence. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><b>Formation of School of 
      Thought: </b>Madhab developed as Muslims came in touch with new people and 
      new lands and came in contact with varied cultures, differing 
      socio-economic background and have to deal with the multiplicity of new 
      customs and problems and because the sahaba spread over different lands 
      and practiced individual ijtihad. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Madhab developed due to 
      the later breakdown of the unified political leadership and the scholars 
      of the respective madhabs were obliged to make rulings without the benefit 
      of mutual consultation in the absence of easy and faster communication.&nbsp; 
      Scholars were caught up in the political rivalry resulting from the 
      splintering of state leadership.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Madhab developed when the 
      caliphate turned into hereditary kingship and some of the caliphs 
      attempted to maneuver and manipulate Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) in order 
      to justify their deviations. The religious scholars (ulama) therefore 
      refused to sit in the audiences of the caliph and in fact fled to remote 
      areas to avoid conflict and persecution and they started to give rulings 
      from their isolated centers, which differed with the ruling of the 
      scholars representing the establishment. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Madhab also flourished 
      because of the court debate. The scholars holding diverse views debated to 
      prove their competence in front of the ruler to gain financial benefits.&nbsp; 
      These scholars represented this or that madhab; any debacle in the debate 
      was considered loss of prestige for the madhab. Thus ridiculous court 
      debates promoted rivalry and encouraged madhab factionalism and as a 
      result madhab sectarianism and dogmatism became rampant among the court 
      scholars.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Madhab developed in the 
      face of Umayyad deviation from the practices of the Prophet (sunnah); the 
      scholars of the later generation in order to preserve essential principles 
      of Islam began to compile the ijtihad of the sahaba.&nbsp; The isolated 
      scholars relied on hadith and compiled legal rulings of the most prominent 
      jurists among the sahaba. Those who had studied under the sahaba in the 
      various centers of learning thought that if determined efforts were not 
      made to preserve the earlier rulings, the later generations of Muslims 
      would be unable to benefit from the contributions of the sahaba. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Madhav developed when the 
      Muslim government wanted to adopt one solution to the various issues the 
      public faced as different rulings were implemented, in others words the 
      rulers wanted to implement a standard; and as answer and solution to this 
      the concept of taqlid or to remain within the boundary of one School of 
      Thought was introduced as a solution. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><b>Reasons for Difference 
      in Ruling: </b>The reasons for contradiction in the ruling of the earlier 
      scholars are essentially because of difference in word meanings- literal 
      and metaphorical, the grammatical construction of the sentence that gives 
      options for more than one interpretation. Because of the linguistic 
      ambiguity scholar’s differed while trying to ascertain the intent of the 
      text. Earlier Imams developed a number of principles on which they based 
      their rulings. As a result, both the rulings and the principles became 
      sources of differences among jurists.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Differences among the 
      scholars were due to the fact that they had been exposed to various 
      different hadiths of the Prophet, some heard some and others did not know 
      about those. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">The scholars also 
      differed on the authenticity and validity of the individual hadith due to 
      one or other reasons, condition imposed for their acceptance and how to 
      reconcile the apparent contradiction of different hadiths. Hadiths were 
      also compiled much later. Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi and Hambali madhabs were 
      founded between the middle of eighth century and early part of ninth 
      century, whereas the Sihah Sitta (The Sound Six Books of hadith) the most 
      authentic and comprehensive compilation of hadith namely Bukhari, Muslim, 
      Abu Dawud, At Tirmidi, An Nasai and Ibn Majah were not available until the 
      later part of the ninth century and early tenth century. Had all these 
      compiled books of hadith been available in printed form to all the earlier 
      great Imams, no doubt difference of their ruling would have been less.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Early scholars also took 
      different positions regarding the status of weak and unreliable hadith (daif 
      hadith). Some viewed that weak hadith should get preference over the 
      analogical deduction (qiyas) and therefore they reached different 
      conclusions. Imam Abu Hanifa ruled that a hadith has to be well known (mashur) 
      if it has to be accepted as valid hadith. Imam Malik opined that any 
      hadith that contradicts the prevailing customs of Madina is not valid. 
      Imam Shafi insisted that hadith to be acceptable must be authentic (sahih). 
      On the other hand, Imam Ahmad Ibn Hambal considered a hadith attributed to 
      the Prophet but there is a break in the chain of narrator (mursal hadith) 
      acceptable. Due to all these differences early scholars ruled differently.
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Deductive reasoning (qiyas) 
      was generally accepted, but the rules governing its deductive procedures 
      varied among the Imams, resulting in variation in their rulings on the 
      similar issues.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Abu Hanifa used analogy (qiyas) 
      extensively when he faced an unmatched and first-time case; he derived an 
      Islamic rule for it by making an analogy between the case and similar one 
      that has specific ruling of the Quran and sunnah. But some jurists reject 
      analogical deduction (qiyas) altogether. In areas where there is no 
      explicit text, the jurists apply their mind, exert their efforts in the 
      light of general principle of Islamic law (shariah) and earlier experience 
      and they try to find out solutions. In such areas the chance of difference 
      is more.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">The majority of the 
      jurists, for example, recognized the validity of consensus (ijma) among 
      the generations after the sahaba, but Imam Shafi questioned its validity 
      while Imam Ahmed Ibn Hambal rejected it outright. Similarly the major 
      jurists rejected Imam Malik’s reliance on customs of Madina as a source of 
      legislation. Imam Malik accepted the consensus (ijma) as a source of law 
      but limited it to the community of the Companion of Prophet (sabaha), the 
      resident of the city of Madina, Imam Shafi on the other hand rejected the 
      idea of limiting consensus to the community of Madina saying it is all 
      Muslims at any given time, as represented by the community of scholars. 
      Imam Abu Hanifa’s principle of preference (istihsan) and Imam Malik’s 
      welfare (istislah) were both disallowed by Imam Shafi. On the other hand, 
      Imam Shafi felt that the opinion of the sahaba had to be accepted on legal 
      matters, while others felt that their analogical deduction (qiyas) was not 
      binding on the later generations.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><b>Flexibility of School 
      of Thought: </b>In the early stage in the development of madhab the 
      scholars were flexible and lack rigidity and dogmatism, issues were 
      objectively analyzed and conclusions reached on the basis of strength of 
      proofs presented. The great Imams of the madhabs were always willing to 
      change their rulings. This clearly illustrates the absence of rigidity and 
      sectarianism, which is common feature of the later scholars. Early 
      scholars were against blindly following rulings merely because prominent 
      scholars had made them. Iman Abu Hanifa and Imam Malik were always ready 
      to forgo their opinions if they found a correct hadith, which contradict 
      their opinion. Imam Ahmad Ibn Hambal and his students Imam Bukhari 
      (810-870) and Imam Muslim (817-875) who did extensive work on collection 
      of hadith refused to follow unquestioningly the traditional earlier 
      rulings of the madhab. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">How flexible the great 
      Imams were would be clear from the fact that Imam Abu Yusuf differed on 
      the ruling of his teacher Imam Abu Hanifa that Islamic prohibition of 
      khamar, wine covered only the product of fermented grape juice (the 
      literal meaning of khamar). According to the ruling of Imam Abu Hanifa 
      intoxicating drinks made from other sources were allowed so long as the 
      consumer did not become drunk. Imam Abu Yusuf rejected the ruling of his 
      teacher Imam Abu Hanifa quoting reliable hadith that earlier did not come 
      to notice of Imam Abu Hanifa and ruled that all intoxicants are to be 
      included in the meaning of khamar. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">The flexibility is 
      further proved from the fact that caliph Abu Jafar Al Mansur (754-775) 
      wanted to make the compilation of hadiths by Imam Malik known as Muwatta 
      the state law binding on all Muslims which Imam Malik refused on the 
      ground that there may be other hadiths with other companions of the 
      Prophet who have settled in other parts of the Arabia and not known to him 
      and if those hadiths were known to him he might have concluded 
      differently.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><b>Rigidity of School of 
      Thought: </b>The liberal thinking which characterized the early Imams down 
      through the ages has later been replaced by certain rigidity and 
      dogmatism. Since the late thirteen century the madhabs have become the 
      breeding ground of sectarianism, the fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) lost its 
      original vitality which enshrined the principle of ijtihad and thus has 
      not been able to keep pace with changing time and circumstances. As a 
      result of madhab sectarianism and fiqh inflexibility the traditional 
      purity, unity and dynamism of Islam have been threatened throughout the 
      Muslim world. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">There was a trend of 
      rigidity and breaking down of flexibility under the second generation of 
      students which is contrary to the teaching and practice of the period of 
      the great Imams. During this period ijtihad beyond the structure of the 
      madhab was forbidden. Scholars started to exercise ijtihad and give ruling 
      within the outline and limit of the jurisdiction of the madhab; and 
      comparative fiqh was used essentially to advocate sectarian ideas. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><b>Blind Imitation: </b>
      The period of stagnation and decline covers starting from 1285 and ending 
      around the middle of nineteenth century that coincided with the rise of 
      Ottoman Empire founded in 1299 until its decline and fall to European 
      colonial masters who replaced Islamic shariah throughout the Muslim world 
      by European laws.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">This period is 
      characterized with the blind imitation of the earlier scholars. Scholarly 
      exercise was restricted to writing commentaries of the previous works and 
      further promoting sectarian view. First the scholars abridged and 
      condensed the contribution of the Imams and later generation of scholars 
      began to write explanations and commentaries of the summaries and added 
      footnotes. They concluded that one of the four madhabs has to be followed 
      if one’s Islam is to be valid. Thus Islam became restricted within the 
      four walls of existing four madhabs- Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi and Hambali.
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Sectarian scholars ruled 
      that the blind following of one of the four madhab that virtually split 
      the ummah into four religious sects was obligatory on all Muslims. 
      Everyone was asked to follow one of them and not change madhab or not pick 
      up from this or that madhab and those who refused to follow particular 
      madhab and picked up ruling from this or that madhab at the same time were 
      described as religious heretic although madhab is not infallible and 
      following one madhab was and is not mandatory and binding for Muslims. The 
      person who insists every Muslim to follow one or another of the four 
      madhabs despite glaring contradictions in their rulings on points of 
      Islamic law is taqlid.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Some people claim that 
      madhabs are divinely ordained and the Prophet himself prophesied the 
      coming of Imams. The hadiths quoted to defend madhab sectarianism are 
      either misinterpreted or unauthentic and fabricated for example the 
      commonly quoted sayings of the Prophet “There will be among my ummah a man 
      called Abu Hanifa, he will be lamp of my ummah” and “There will come after 
      me a man called Abu Hanifa. Allah’s religion and my sunnah will be revived 
      by him”. But this two are classified as forged (mawdu) and fabricated and 
      unacceptable (matrouk) [Abu Ameenah Bilal Philips, <i>The Evolution of 
      Fiqh</i>,<i> </i>Tawheed Publications, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Second 
      Edition, 1990, pp132-133 quoted from Muhammad Ibn Ali Ash Shawkani, <i>Al 
      Fawaid Al Majmuah</i>, Bairut, 2<sup>nd</sup> ed., 1972, p320, no. 1226 
      and Ali Ibn Iraq, <i>Tanzih Ash Shariah Al Marfuah</i>, Bairut, 1979, vol. 
      2, p30, no. 10]. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">There were continuing 
      search for truth until such time negative factors like sectarianism became 
      dominant among some scholars. Then indeed taqlid, blind following of 
      madhabs coupled with ban on ijtihad led to the widespread promotion of 
      sectarianism and the decline for search for truth among the scholars. 
      Followers of madhabs took extreme sectarian attitude and they discarded 
      ijtihad and imposed upon the general Muslims the blind following of one of 
      the four madhabs.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Ijtihad was put aside. 
      Most of the scholars ruled that the door of ijtihad is closed permanently. 
      They argued that all possible issues has already been addressed, no 
      further new issue will come up in future and therefore no need of further 
      ijtihad. Ijtihad thus ceased to play its role as the guiding force that 
      inspired Muslim creativity and ingenuity. Shariah therefore ceased to 
      produce the living, dynamic civilization it once created in the golden 
      days of Islam. The decline of Islam has been due to the decline and 
      suspension of ijtihad. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><b>Early Scholars &amp; 
      Stagnation of Thought: </b>The Imams based their ruling on the evidence 
      available to them at the time of ruling. The ruling differed due to social 
      environment and cultural differences and hence difference of opinion 
      aroused from region to region and hence multiplication of madhabs.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">The Imams to whom the 
      four schools are attributed were themselves out and out against blind 
      imitation and passionately fought against taqlid.&nbsp; But most of the Muslims 
      are not aware that blind following a madhab is absolutely opposed to the 
      position and teachings of the great Imams. &nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">The students of the Imams 
      have opposed the blind following of their opinion or any opinion. They 
      repeatedly emphasized the importance of enquiring from the primary sources 
      – Quran and sunnah before giving any ruling. The Imams and their students 
      emphasized that they are not infallible and their rulings are subject to 
      error.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">The Imams gave preference 
      to hadith to their opinion. On the basis of authentic hadith not available 
      to the Imams their students overruled several rulings made by the Imams.
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">The four Imams and their 
      students demanded strict adherence to the hadiths and prohibited the blind 
      imitation of their opinions. The preference of the Imam’s opinion over the 
      Prophet is itself in total opposition to the stand taken by the Imam. 
      Giving preference to the opinion of madhab over Prophet tantamount to 
      shirk, associating partners with Allah technically known as shirk fee 
      tawhid al ittiba. The unquestioned following belongs only to Allah and His 
      Prophet. To discard certain reliable hadiths simply because they 
      contradict some of the opinions of the Imams of his madhab, is to be in 
      total opposition the position taken by the Imams themselves. Moreover, 
      rejection of reliable hadiths tantamount to rejection of Allah and His 
      Messenger.&nbsp; Al Quran states: But no by your Lord, they can have no real 
      faith until they make you judge in all disputes between them and find in 
      their souls no resistance against your decisions, but accept them with the 
      fullest conviction [Al Quran 4(Surat An Nisa); 65]. The Muslims are 
      therefore required to scrutinize the rulings of the earlier scholars 
      before following any opinion.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">The European Council for 
      Fatwa and Research of which Prof. Dr. Yusuf Al Qaradawi is the President 
      in its ruling states: “Abiding by a certain madhab (School of Fiqh) is not 
      a religious obligation. Neither Allah nor His Messenger oblige us to abide 
      by Hanafi, Malik School or otherwise. Muslims are to abide by the Quran 
      and the sunnah. These are the two authentic, perfect, infallible sources, 
      whereas every individual judgment is subject to acceptance and rejection. 
      The renowned Imams themselves forbade others to unquestionably adopt their 
      opinions”[Quoted in ‘<i>Can I Follow Another School of Fiqh</i>?’ http://www.islamonline.net/fatwa/english/FatwaDisplay.asp?hFatwaID=34972].</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Nevertheless the 
      prohibition of taqlid does not mean that everyone must return to the 
      sources before anything and it does not mean that all the work of the 
      earlier scholars should be outright rejected or ignored for that would be 
      impractical and in most cases impossible. It does however mean that those 
      who have sufficient knowledge of the various branches of Islamic sciences 
      should not hesitate to look at the sources as well as the opinions of all 
      scholars regardless of the madhab. A scholar should be open minded in his 
      search for knowledge otherwise his rulings are likely to be biased and 
      sectarian. He should consult the earlier contributions and take what is 
      good for the present circumstance.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">If qualified, 
      legitimately chosen leaders in a given Muslim community or association see 
      it fit to adopt certain juristic position for the general welfare of the 
      community, or give valid preference to some options over others, it is 
      essential for the members to honor those positions. But blind or absolute 
      loyalty of one person or particular Juristic School is not befitting of 
      any Muslim. The shariah recognizes the wisdom of following juristic 
      authorities; learn the basis of their judgments and approach them with an 
      open mind for guidance or correction- even if they differ with one’s own 
      basis or juristic affiliation. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><b>Reasons for 
      Intellectual Stagnation: </b>Taqlid, blind imitation is the result of a 
      number of factors that led to intellectual stagnation. The break down of 
      the Abbasid Caliphate into mini-states, each state following a particular 
      madhab- Egypt followed Shafi madhab, Spain the Maliki madhab and Turkey 
      and Bangladesh-Pakistan-India subcontinent Hanafi madhab- destroyed the 
      unity of thought of the Muslim ummah. Each state appointed qadi, judge of 
      its own madhab who decreed according to its own madhab. Moreover religious 
      scholars (ulama) who wanted to be state appointed judges became follower 
      of particular madhab and gave ruling accordingly.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">The fall of Baghdad and 
      eventual subjugation of Muslim lands by colonial European powers who 
      introduced secular laws in the concurred lands made Muslims apprehensive 
      and their instinct self-preservation led them jealously exclude all types 
      of innovation in the shariah as expounded by the early scholars of Islam 
      and consequently, most of the people consciously or unconsciously became 
      captive of blind imitation which limited everything to the literal 
      observance of the Islamic precepts and blind obedience to past decisions.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Some unqualified and 
      incompetent persons started to give rulings that were apparently not 
      correct. Reputed scholars, in such backdrop, issued fatwa, rulings 
      decreeing the general ban on ijtihad to protect the shariah from being 
      tempered.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Scholars at this time 
      wrote books on the correct method of making ijtihad and put such 
      conditions- rigorous criteria - that made the exercise of ijtihad 
      impossible by the then scholars.&nbsp; The conditions had been so strict that 
      if these conditions were taken into cognizance the ijtihad of the earlier 
      scholars would have become invalid.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><b>Reform Movement: </b>
      We should not forget that all Muslims- even the scholars of the earlier 
      generation, with the exception of Prophet Muhammad, are fallible and 
      therefore even those earlier interpretations cannot and should not be 
      followed blindly without regard to certain basic principles of reasons 
      which enable us to differentiate between right and wrong. The question of 
      slavishly following a single madhab therefore does not arise regardless of 
      the errors in those.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">There were praiseworthy 
      attempts by certain reformers to revive the original dynamism but their 
      efforts proved unequal to the task of eliminating the deep-rooted madhab 
      factionalism and fanaticism. Attempts to codify Islamic law were made but 
      this was a failure because of sectarian approach.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">The Ottoman Caliph 
      appointed a panel of seven top ranking scholars of fiqh to codify Islamic 
      law to enforce throughout the empire and this was completed in 1876 – 
      title of the book: Majallah Al Ahkam Al Aadilah. But the good effort 
      failed due to madhab fanaticism particularly because all the scholars of 
      the panel of seven jurists were from Hanafai madhab who ignored the 
      contribution of other madhabs as a result of which all other madhabs did 
      not accept this contribution.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">In spite of the general 
      decay a few eminent scholars opposed taqlid and raised the banner of 
      ijtihad who urged upon the Muslim leaders of thought and scholars to 
      return to the original roots of shariah and for reliance on those 
      foundations only rather than solely depending on the contributions of 
      earlier scholars and imitating them. The notable among them are Imam Ahmad 
      Ibn Taimiya (1263-1328), Shah Wali Allah Dehlavi (1703-1762), Muhammad Ibn 
      Ali Ash Shawkani (1757-1835), Jamal Uddin Afghani (1839-1897) and Muhammad 
      Abduh (1849-1905), Muhammad Rashid Rida (d.1935), Hassan Al Banna 
      (d.1949), Muhammad Al Ghazali (1917-1996), Abul Ala Mawdudi (1903-1979), 
      Nasir Uddin Albani (1914-1999), Yusuf Al Qaradawi (b.1926). </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Ibn Taimiya’s students 
      particularly Ibn Qayyim and Ibn Kathir carried forward the banner of 
      ijtihad and the call to return to the original sources of the Islamic law 
      and jurisprudence. Shah Wali Allah Dehlavi called for reopening of the 
      door of ijtihad and for the reunification of the madhab. He taught that 
      everyone is free to choose a particular decision differing from particular 
      madhab. Muhammad Ibn Ali Ash Shawkani completely freed himself from madhab 
      sectarianism and started to make independent ijtihad and give ruling. He 
      took the position that taqlid is forbidden and in support of his opinion 
      he wrote a number of books notably Al Qawl Al Mufid Fee Hukum At Taqlid. 
      &nbsp;Jamal Uddin Afghani denounced taqlid and called for free political, 
      religious and scientific thought. Muhammad Abduh raised the banner of 
      ijtihad and made systematic attack on taqlid and its supporters. Muhammad 
      Rashid Rida further carried forward the fight of Muhammad Abduh against 
      taqlid.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">More recent scholars like 
      Hassan Al Banna, Muhammad Al Ghazali and Yusuf Al Qaradawi of Egypt, Abul 
      Ala Mawdudi of Pakistan and Nasir Uddin Albani of Albania have picked up 
      the banner of the call of Islamic revival and emphasized for the 
      unification of the madhabs. Banna’s follower Sayyid Sabiq in his book Fiqh 
      As Sunnah urged for the unification of madhab in view of the chaotic 
      situation prevailing in the Muslim world and tried to justify the call for 
      unification. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">The Fiqh Academy of the 
      Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) is also playing important role in 
      developing unified fiqh. Being a representative body of the Muslim 
      countries it is largely free from sectarian approach. Its activities are 
      however very limited and until now it has not been able to attract the 
      attention of the large body of religious scholars (ulama) throughout the 
      Muslim world.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Although madhab 
      fanaticism is facing resistance in recent time from the reformist 
      movements because the study of comparative fiqh is being encouraged in the 
      major seat of learning nonetheless the existence of madhab factionalism 
      have continued until the present day and that is the reason for which 
      Muslim could not as yet come out of the state of stagnation and decline. 
      There has however been some lessening of madhab fanaticism in recent years 
      as a result of reformist movements and teaching of comparative fiqh in 
      modern institution of learning.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">The reform movement (nadah) 
      worldwide, from Indonesia to Morocco as also the Muslim intellectual 
      movement in the west as of today guided by all comprehensive 
      socio-political consideration abhor the blind imitation (taqlid) and 
      advocate independent reasoning in matters of legal judgment (ijtihad) and 
      stress the need for continuous, ceaseless struggle to fulfill the divine 
      obligation of founding an Islamic order. This is the positive development.
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><b>Way-out: </b>The 
      Muslims scholars today are in close contact once again because of faster 
      and easy mass communication. There have been encouraging signs towards the 
      revival of Islam as the important factor in Muslim life, at individual, 
      social and state levels.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">The contemporary 
      realization that taqlid resulted in intellectual decline, social decadence 
      and eventual acquiescence to western mode of civilization had led to a 
      renewed call to reopen the gate of ijtihad to proceed to the work of 
      reconstructing a dynamic, thriving civilization of Islam. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">The Muslim scholars 
      earnestly believe that in spite of multiplicity of cultures and the 
      diversity of issues and problems arising in the rapidly changing world, it 
      is possible to reestablish Islam in all parts of the world and in the 
      Muslim’s daily life only through the revival of dynamic fiqh. The dynamism 
      of the shariah is due to the expanding role of the ijtihad which need to 
      be exercised by all qualified Muslim scholars. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">This implies a 
      reunification of the madhabs removing all traces of fanaticism and 
      sectarianism, and the renewal of ijtihad to make fiqh a more dynamic, 
      objectively deduced body of laws so that individual Muslim scholars and 
      jurists may successfully and equally apply the shariah in all parts of the 
      Muslim world.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 12.0pt">
      Unified madhab and dynamic body of fiqh is needed in order to evolve 
      lively and vibrant Islamic societies and unite such societies throughout 
      the world in all types of cooperative endeavors that would protect the 
      common interest of mankind and project Islam on a global scale.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 12.0pt">
      Resolute efforts will have to be made to resolve the differences between 
      the existing madhabs in an objective way using the methodology used by the 
      early scholars.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 12.0pt">To 
      workout the procedural details as to how to affect changes progressive and 
      enlightened scholars of high talent will have to take initiative and 
      communicate with other persons and institutions for this purpose. The 
      steps inter alia include identifying the real obstacles to solution, 
      selection of the most appropriate solution, determination of possible 
      methods of implementation, selection of the most appropriate method, then 
      putting the solution into effect. Such steps need to be constantly 
      evaluated in respect of the problems and goals. Obviously the task of 
      unifying madhabs and restoring dynamic fiqh are not susceptible to 
      simplistic solutions.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 12.0pt">
      Resolution of totally contradictory position in fiqh (ikhtilaf tadad) 
      which cannot be simultaneously correct is on the whole difficult. 
      Conflicting rulings (iktilaf tanawwu) that are logically acceptable can 
      coexist. In cases of differences arising from literal and metaphoric 
      meanings of words and grammatical constructions, specified meanings 
      established through authentic hadith should be given preference over all 
      other interpretations.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 12.0pt">
      Similarly legal rulings made in the absence of hadith or based on weak 
      hadith in place of authentic hadith should be replaced by the rulings of 
      jurists, which were made on the basis of authentic hadith.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 12.0pt">
      Deductive ruling (qiyas) should be objectively examined in the light of 
      the basic principle of the Quran and sunnah. Ijma (consensus) of the 
      sahaba is no doubt a proof (hujja) for all Muslims. This however does not 
      mean that matters agreed on by the earlier generations are not open to 
      ijtihad. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 12.0pt">
      However where there is more than one ruling, these are to be applied 
      according to circumstances as viable options.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 12.0pt">The 
      resolution of the differences among the madhabs could best be affected by 
      establishing institutions devoted to the objective study of fiqh. In such 
      institutions of learning no madhab will be given preference over another. 
      Islamic law needs to be studied from primary sources and the position of 
      various madhabs could be then analyzed rationally and objectively. If the 
      standards of scholarship in such centers of learning are high, the fiqh 
      differences will gradually reduced to a minimum. Such institutions would 
      not only provide trustworthy leadership to the Muslim world in general, 
      but also provide concrete guidance to various reformist movements aimed at 
      reestablishing Islamic order. We have to overcome the petty differences 
      and workout the basis for theoretical framework and basis for maintaining 
      unity of ummah<b>: </b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">The guidelines should be 
      searched from the Quran and find out the ruling when certain problem is 
      faced. The authentic hadith literature should be scanned if there is no 
      specific instruction in the Quran to find out the ruling on problem faced.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">The scholars of the 
      country should consult among themselves (shura) if no solution is found 
      out in the Quran and sunnah.&nbsp; In this age of Internet scholars of 
      different countries can make exchange among them to ascertain the ruling 
      of Islam to a particular problem. The decision of the majority should be 
      upheld if unanimous decision cannot be reached through consultation.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">This unified procedure, 
      followed by the Rightly Guided Caliphs (kholafa-e-rashadeen) would promote 
      unity and provide little or no scope and opportunity for factionalism 
      within the Muslim ummah. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 12.0pt">
      Thinking section of the Muslim ummah however must realize that onward 
      march and progress of the Islamic societies from a more or less stagnant 
      condition can systematically begin only if the critical faculties of the 
      mass of the society are awakened and employed. This essentially means a 
      critical appraisal of all that has traditionally been accepted as Islamic. 
      This appraisal is not a one time effort but a continuous process that 
      underscores the importance of examining the bulk of hadith literature, 
      which is of questionable validity and requires afresh examination and wed 
      out what contradicts with Quran and the general objective and sprit of 
      Islam. The proposed institutions, in addition to working for unified 
      madhab and restore dynamic fiqh, must shoulder the gigantic responsibility 
      of reexamining the hadith literature. As Fazlur Rahman, Director of 
      Central Institute of Islamic Research, Karachi, Pakistan puts it: &nbsp;“If the 
      study of early hadith materials is carried through with constructive 
      purposiveness under the canons of historical criticism and in relation to 
      the historico-sociological background, they [would] take a new meaning. … 
      May we request our ulama to study these materials with the necessary and 
      relevant background? We feel certain that once this is done, the whole 
      question of how the Quran and the sunnah are to be interpreted will take a 
      new meaning for the traditional students of the madrasha” [Fazlur Rahman,
      <i>Islamic Methodology in History</i>, Central Institute of Islamic 
      Research, Karachi, Pakistan, 1965, pp178,183-184]. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><b>Unity a Mercy. 
      Difference Not a Blessing: </b>This article shall not be complete if a few 
      words are not said about the contention of a section of people that 
      difference of opinion or disagreement is a mercy of Allah on the ummah. 
      Such a statement however contradicts the Quran. Al Quran states: Hold fast 
      the rope of Allah together and do not split up. And remember Allah’s mercy 
      on you when you were enemies, then He put love in your hearts and with His 
      blessing you all became brothers [Al Quran 3 (Surat Al Imran): 103].&nbsp; Thus 
      the Quran explicitly and implicitly condemns conflict and dispute among 
      Muslims. Critical evaluation or ijtihad is not disagreement and mercy is 
      on those who evaluate critically. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">All the hadiths quoted in 
      support of disagreement are defective this or that way. For example: 
      “Disagreement among my nation is a mercy” - not recorded and therefore 
      fabricated. “Differences among my sahabas are a mercy for you” – extremely 
      weak and unauthentic “My sabahas are like stars. You will be guided by 
      whichever of them you follow”- mawdo or fabricated and unauthentic. 
      “Verily my sabahas are like stars. You will be guided by any statement of 
      theirs you adopt”- mawdo or fabricated. “I asked my Lord about the things 
      in which my companions will differ after my death and Allah revealed to 
      me: Oh Muhammad verily to Me, your companions are like stars in the sky, 
      some brighter than others. So, he who follows anything over which they 
      (the sabahas) have differed, as far as I am concerned, he will be 
      following guidance”- batil or false. [Abu Ameenah Bilal Philips, <i>The 
      Evolution of Fiqh</i>, Tawheed Publications, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Second 
      Edition, 1990, pp132-133 quoted from <i>Bayhaqee, Silsilah Al Ahadith Ad 
      Daifah Wa Al Mawduah</i> (Bairut: Al Maktab Al Islami, 3<sup>rd</sup> 
      ed.,1972, vol 1, p82), <i>Al Kifayah Fee Ilm Ar Riwayah</i>, Cairo, 2<sup>nd</sup> 
      ed.,1972 and <i>Silsilah&nbsp; Al Ahadith Ad Daifah</i>, vol. 1, pp80-81 for 2<sup>nd</sup>, 
      3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> hadiths respectively] 
      Thus the question of glorification of differences of opinion does not 
      arise and it is totally unacceptable from the point of view of 
      authenticity.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">On the contrary the Quran 
      states people on whom will be the mercy of Allah are the people who are 
      united. Al Quran states: If your Lord had so willed He could have made 
      mankind one people; but they will not cease to dispute except those on 
      whom your Lord has bestowed His mercy [Al Quran 11 (Surat Hud): 118-119]. 
      If Allah’s mercy puts an end to dispute among men as implied in this 
      verse, how could disagreement and dispute be a mercy?&nbsp; </p>
