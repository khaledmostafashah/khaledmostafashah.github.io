      <p class="MsoBodyText2">Bertrand Russell making the opening remarks at the
      inaugural session of the Vietnam War Crime Tribunal in London on 13
      November 1966 made the historic statement that ‘silence is a crime’.
      Silence is a crime against humanity. It is still a bigger heinous crime
      when people remain silent in opposition to their own conscience against
      killing of noncombatant innocent civilians, old, women and children,
      whether such incident takes place in their vicinity or in any distant far
      flung area and when people remain silent just because the perpetrators of
      such crime are powerful elements though such crime has been committed in
      front of their very eyes and within their knowledge. Silence feeds the
      evil, emboldens the murderer and the arsonist. Sometimes efforts are being
      made to justify such crime on different alibi using sugarcoated words and
      Gobbles propaganda. The recent incident in Gujrat is a glaring example of
      dreadful and appalling crime engineered by hypocrite communal Hindu
      leadership of India.<o:p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText2">The riot, which began in the India’s western
      state of Gujrat on 27 February 2002, has until now no sign of end. More
      than 5000 Muslims were killed of which 122 were burnt alive including a
      Muslim former member of the Indian parliament. This slaughter of innocent
      Muslims is the result of planned, calculated and coolheaded murder. The
      death includes old men, women and children. Hindu rioters used swords,
      rifles, petrol bombs and acid bombs. LPG Gas Cylinders and Oxygen Gas
      Cylinders were used to explode commercial establishments, residential
      quarters and mosques. As a result of the massacre, more than 350 mosques
      were demolished and property worth U.S. $500 million damaged and over
      100,000 people have become homeless who are living in 56 different
      makeshift relief camps (not even one camp for the Hindus from which one
      can imagine the number of Hindus affected and the truth of the allegation
      that Muslims killed large number of Hindus) including one camp established
      within the Muslim graveyard in south Ahmedabad and in dire need of
      financial assistance as they have lost dwelling houses and businesses, and
      children lost guardians and have become orphans (Indian Muslim Relief
      Committee, ISNA, USA. <a href="http://www.imrc.ws/html/gujrat_riots.html).In"><span style="text-decoration:none;text-underline:none">www.imrc.ws/html/gujrat_riots.html).
      In</span></a> 40 cities and 2000 villages 250,000 Muslims overnight have
      turned destitute, reported Rafiq Zakaria in an article ‘In the Land of
      Gandhi’<sup>1</sup>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
      number of deaths increased due to the anti-Muslim outlook of the India’s
      predominantly Hindu police and the failure of the Indian government to
      deploy army when the trouble started on February 27. “The entire nation
      is shocked at the callousness and inefficiency displayed by the law and
      order machinery of the government of Gujrat”, said L. Ramadas former
      Chief of the Indian Navy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2">This is not the first time communal violence
      erupted in Gujrat, the ‘laboratory of Hindutva’. The first major
      communal carnage in post independent India (1947) took place in 1969.
      Since then Gujrat has witnessed several more riots- in 1981, in 1985, in
      1990, in 1992-1993 and now in 2002 and in between several others. The most
      regrettable part of the carnage is that the ruling BJP government of
      Gujrat to advance its political agenda has used leaderless backward Dalit
      Hindus to attack minority Muslims of the state. The recent bloodbath in
      Gujrat is the culmination of years of unabated communal violence, most
      brutal, burning victims alive and throwing even the young children into
      the rising flames. Another unfortunate and deplorable aspect of the Gujrat
      mass murder is that all sections of Hindu civil society, the state organs
      and government machinery and even the judiciary became thoroughly
      communalized and played dirty role and; this could happen as never in the
      past offenders or culprits of such crime were punished.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span><u><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </u></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2">The sad part of this mass murder, indeed a
      massacre, is that the people of Bangladesh being totally dependent on such
      media sources as PTI, AP, Reuter, BBC, CNN and such other unfriendly
      sources is completely unaware as to what has happened in Gujrat although
      Bangladesh and Pakistan being the neighbouring Muslim countries could make
      first hand factual report on the situation in Gujrat for the benefit of
      conscientious people worldwide. In the absence of active and positive role
      by the Bangladesh media, the people of our country remained in total
      darkness as to what has happened in Gujrat. The inactive role of the
      Muslim media, its pacifist attitude gave India the opportunity to make mal
      propaganda, blaming Muslims responsible for the bloodbath in Gujrat.
      Unfortunately al-Jazeera Television, which came to limelight during the
      recent attack on Afghanistan by U.S. led coalition, played no significant
      role in reporting the Muslim massacre in Gujrat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>A careful review and analysis of the world press will however make
      open the hidden hand behind the Muslim bloodbath in Gujrat. Undoubtedly
      underneath the Hindu cultured outfit most of them have stinky underwear of
      communal feelings. Poet Tagore in the backdrop of 1926 Kolkata riot
      sarcastically commented to Poet Nazrul Islam that you could see and sever
      the tail that is outside but cannot sever the tail that is inside
      (Hindu-Muslim. Nazrul Rachanaboli. pp 883- 884 Vol. 1. 1996). Undoubtedly
      Tagore, being himself a Brahmin, was aware of the inner mind of the
      Hindus. What Tagore possibly meant is that the paws and biting teeth’s
      of the Hindus are always hidden.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2">The question is why is this slaughter of Muslims
      in Gujrat ‘in the name of god’ (not God), to quote Salman Rushdie
      (Washington Post. 8 March 2002). Beneath however lies the Hindu
      psychology, which is reflected in the writing of even such eminent Hindu
      intellectuals and perceived secular as Nirad C. Chaudhury who find
      ‘something unnatural in the continued presence of Muslims in India’
      (The Continent Of Circe. p 298). The Indian mental frame work is also
      reflected in the utterances of the majority community, the Hindus: ‘<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Gaddar
      Hai Musalman: Vejo Usko Pakistan</i> (Muslims are traitors: Send them back
      to Pakistan) or ‘<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Mandir Ka Nirman
      Koro: Babar Ki Aulad Ko Bahar Karo</i> [Start building the Hindu temple in
      place of Babri mosque: Throw the sons (i.e.Muslims) of Babar (the Moghol
      Emperor) out side India]. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Ram Ki Joi:
      Varat Ki Joi</i> (Victory to Lord Ram: Victory to India), <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Ram
      Ki Joi: Hindu Ki Joi</i> (Victory to Lord Ram: Victory to Hindus). The
      situation has been further deteriorated due to the distorted portrayal of
      Muslim rule in India in the school textbooks. Agitated Hindu rioters, to
      justify the killing of Muslims, were shouting: “There is a fire inside
      us. Our blood is boiling”. The Muslims are totally marginalized in the
      Indian society. Even with strength of nearly 250 million, they are being
      systematically suppressed and have no real representation in the corridors
      of power. Their representation in the government, educational institutions
      and economic sectors is abysmal. According to 1981 survey there is 0.4
      percent graduate now among Muslims. Compared to other communities it is
      certainly a dismal figure (Muslim and Education. Dr. Asghar Ali Engineer.
      www.csss@vsnl.com).<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2">Although some prejudiced and intolerant Indian
      press hold that the Muslims are responsible for the riot in Gujrat
      claiming that the killing in Gujrat is the backlash of Godhra in which
      Hindu zealots alleged to have been attacked by the Muslims. The real story
      however is that the trouble broke out on 27 February 2002 when Hindu Kar
      Sevak refused to pay the prices of the tea and snacks of the Muslim shop
      owners. Rajiv Chandrasekaran in Washington Post reported on 6 March 2001
      that the “kar Sevak pulled the headscarves <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(hijab</i>)
      off the Muslim women” and lifted another young Muslim girl of 16 years
      and this provoked the Muslims and there was tussle between the enraged
      Muslims and the Kar Seavak. Sukla Sen of National Alliance of People’s
      Movement relayed the story of another Muslim woman being molested three
      days earlier by Ram Sewaks (www.suklasen@yahoo.com). Ahmed Hassan, the
      Editor of Kolkata based weekly Qalam claimed that Muslim and non-Muslim
      journalists alike believe that VHP and RSS are responsible for the attack
      on the train carrying Kar Sevak not the local Muslim.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2">The Hindu mind is however very much prejudiced and
      parochial. The Hindu in its issue of 18 March 2002 reported that RSS Joint
      General Secretary Madan Das reiterated that Muslims would be safe in India
      provided they won the goodwill (or the mercy!) of the majority community.
      This is a “veiled threat” to the Muslim as pointed out by Dr. Asghar
      Ali Engineer, eminent Indian intellectual and Chairman of the Centre for
      Study of Society and Secularism Mumbai. Indian leading columnist Kuldip
      Nayar has also raised question on the new warning to the Muslim that their
      “safety lies in the goodwill of the majority” (The RSS <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">fatwa</i>.
      Daiily Star. 24 March 2002). Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha of RSS after
      three-day conference at Banglore adopted the resolution: “Let Muslim
      understand that their real safety lies in the good will of the Hindus”,
      reported the Hindu (18 March 2002). Minority interest however must not be
      hostage to the goodwill of the majority. How the fundamental rights of one
      community can be the subject matter of another community’s mercy?
      Muslims have never been safe in India and India is perhaps the only
      country in the world where hardly a day goes without some kind of communal
      violence and gruesome murder of the Muslims. Gujrat Chief Minister
      Narendra Modi in an interview with BBC described the performance of his
      government in protecting the life and property of the Muslims of Gujrat as
      a ‘success story’ although he did not impose precautionary curfew nor
      deployed any paramilitary forces and ordered the deployment of army 36
      hours after the bloody trouble begin just to give the unruly Hindu zealots
      and mob enough time to complete the massacre of the Muslim life, honour,
      dignity and property. The Guardian (2 March 2002) however accused that the
      Hindu police ‘merely watched’ as gangs rampaged through the Muslim
      area and the region ‘transformed into a film-like war zone’. The
      response of the Hindu nationalist-led government to the subcontinent’s
      worst communal violence in a decade has so far dismal, the report
      emphasized. The “abdication of responsibility is also evident from
      reports that the police were often passive bystanders during the mayhem
      perpetrated by the rioters”, the Hindustan Times editorial commented.
      The government did little more than ‘public relations stunt’. Hindu
      mobs across the state of Gujrat systematically turned on their neighbours
      and general belief among the conscious citizen is that Gujrat massacre was
      done with the ‘connivance of the state police’ when the nationalists
      called for a state wide strike. The call for shutdown had the support of
      state government run by the party of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
      Chief Minister Modi is on record having said that the people of Gujrat
      have shown “a lot of restrain” though 5000 Muslims were killed,
      100,000 became homeless, property worth of U.S. $500 million destroyed and
      250,000 Muslims became destitute overnight. The Hindu editorial commented:
      “The singularly inept and slow response to the scenes of destruction and
      death raises disturbing questions about the Gujrat state government’s
      approach”. The Hindu editorial blamed the Gujrat government for
      “deliberate lack of firmness in containing the orgy of violence”.
      Writing in the Observer (UK. 3 March 2002) Luke Harding from Ahmedabad
      reported that the massacre of the Muslim of Gujrat ‘has been
      state-sponsored’ and ‘police took part in the slaughter’. “The
      authorities have done little to prevent the inferno that has swept the
      western state of Gujrat – not because of incompetence but because they
      share the prejudice of the Hindu gangs who have been busy pulping their
      Muslim neighbours’, the report stated. “The police even misguided the
      Muslims and handed them over to hands of the rioters. There have been many
      reports of police firing directly on the Muslims, which was the target of
      mob violence. In one particular case when a young Muslim woman in
      Ahmedabad with her three month old son sought the protection of police,
      the police constable directed her to ‘safety’ and she found herself
      surrounded by a mob” (Harsh Mander. www.harshm@actionaid.india.org).
      Even British national Mohammad Aswat Nallabhai on a social visit to the
      area was not spared and the British Foreign Office confirmed his death.
      BBC’s Delhi correspondent Satish Jacob quoting Police Inspector Kirit
      Areda reported that hard-line Hindu leader of Vishwa Hindu Parishad Deepak
      Patel led the Hindu attackers in the recent riot in the state of Gujrat.
      The situation was so bad that “one Muslim woman clung to a
      photographer’s leg, begging him not to leave her for fear she would be
      killed” (<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/03/01/world/main502575.shtml"><span style="text-decoration:none;text-underline:none">www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/03/01/world/main502575.shtml</span></a>).
      Indian Human Rights Commission has also blamed the Gujrat government for
      its failure to control the spread of worst riot in a decade. Reuter from
      New Delhi reported: “The Commission is constrained to observe that a
      serious failure of intelligence and action by the state government marked
      the events leading to Godhara tragedy and the subsequent deaths and
      destruction that occurred”. Indian daily Hindustan Times reported that
      British High Commission in New Delhi made an independent investigation
      over the communal riots in Gujrat and reported the matter to British
      government in London saying the violence was “preplanned” and aimed at
      “removing Muslim influence” from the riot stricken area. “The
      investigation corroborates the wide allegations that Indian security
      forces deployed in Gujrat sided openly with the rioters against the
      Muslims when they were killed, their houses were torched and properties
      looted. Many Muslims in the state were brunt alive with family members and
      the figure is yet to be known”, Bangladesh newspaper the New Nation
      reported on 16 April 2002 quoting the Hindustan Times. “What Gujrat
      witnessed was not a riot, but a terrorist attack followed by a systematic,
      planned massacre, a programme. The leaders were seen communicating on
      mobile telephones from the riot venues, receiving instructions from and
      reporting back to a coordinating center”, wrote Harash Mander an IAS
      Officer who is now working on deputation with a development organization.
      PTI from Washington also reported that the U.S. government expressed its
      “deep concern” over the violence in the western Indian state of Gujrat
      but refused to intervene being an internal affair of India.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2">There is no justification of avoiding or ignoring
      issue of the ethnic cleansing of the Indian Muslims in the name of not
      interfering in the internal affairs of India when more than 5000 Muslim
      were killed, over a hundred thousand Muslim are living in the camps and
      property worth $500 million destroyed. Violation of fundamental human
      rights cannot be and is not a matter of internal affairs and therefore we
      have seen in the past that U.S. have protested killing in the Tiananmen
      Square in China and put economic sanction. We have every legitimate right
      to make India accountable for the killing of Muslims of Gujrat as we have
      opposed in the past killing in Bosnia, Kosava, Chechnya, Kashmir and more
      recent occupation of Palestinian cities by Israel. This is not the
      question of poking nose in other’s matters.<u><o:p>

      </u></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2">U.S. President Bush Jr. and British Prime Minister
      Tony Blair in the post 11 September 2001 scenario are much vocal and
      active in condemning terrorism, of course with the exception of Israeli
      state terrorism. But the Western leaders did not say a single word to
      protect the Indian Muslims although these very leaders become crazy when
      Australian Missionary is being attacked in Orissa, India or a Protestant
      Church in Islamabad, Pakistan is being attacked or when in Pakistan Wall
      Street Journal correspondent Daniel Pearl is kidnapped and killed. “What
      happened in Gujrat was not just instance of religious communities in
      conflict rather it was part of a broader tendency toward eliminating civil
      liberties and scapegoat cultural minorities in an aggressive effort to
      impose a unified sense of nationhood on one of the world’s most
      culturally diverse societies”, commented Arun R Swamy quoting Indian
      political leaders (Asian Times. 5 April 2002).<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2">What has happened to the Muslims of Gujrat under
      the leadership of fascist BJP and infamous “chief monster” (and not
      Chief Minister) Modi (to quote India Today’s cover story ‘Sins of Modi’.
      18 March 2002) resembles Germany in the 1920s and early 1930s. “The
      India’s Hindu nationalists have always resembled 1930s European fascists
      more than the contemporary fundamentalists”, Arun R Swamy wrote in Asia
      Times (Is India going the way of 1930s Germany? 5 April 2002). “The
      analogy to the rise of Hitler is not that should be made lightly, but
      there are many parallels. The Gujrat attacks were not spontaneous
      expression of mob rage but were highly organized and brutally efficient,
      probably identifying the Muslim homes and business through the use of
      public records. The state government was almost certainly complicit in the
      wave of violence that affected the entire state and saw no effort by the
      police to control it. The central government was slow to dispatch the
      army”, Arum R Swamy reported. Newspaper reported, “One finds two
      burned Muslim owned stores amid a row of perfectly intact Hindu
      business” (<a href="http://www.expressindia.com).%20%20this/"><span style="text-decoration:
none;text-underline:none">www.expressindia.com). This</span></a> destruction of
      only Muslim property establishes that the attackers were only Hindus. The
      question naturally arises how did the mob know which store belonged to the
      Muslims unless it is organized. Noted film actress and member of the
      Indian parliament, the Rajya Sabha, Shabana Azmi described Modi as “mass
      murderer” Veteran journalist and the Editor of The Asian Age. M. J.
      Akbar described Narendra Modi as “a politician with a blind eye” (Why
      many questions still hangover India. 4 March 2002).<o:p>

      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2">“The flames of communalism in India have never
      burnt so fiercely as now. It seems that the BJP is applying Hitler’s
      extermination method of Jews to the Muslims who would be flushed out”,
      commented Khaled al-Maeena, Chief Editor of Saudi Arabian prestigious
      newspaper Arab News (Ominous Sign for the Indian Muslims).<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2">Narendra Modi considers Muslims are themselves
      responsible for their killing, a backlash of their own misdeed. He even
      reported to have quoted Newton Third Law (for every action there is
      opposite and equal reaction) to justify the killing of Muslim by the
      Hindus in Gujrat. What a civilized way of behaving by the otherwise
      outwardly polished and cultured Indians. His statement provoked the Hindus
      to kill Muslims. Gujrat President of the VHP Giriraj Kishore supporting
      Modi said: “Its simple science. Hindus are angry and naturally they will
      react. We can’t be slapped on the face and sit quietly? Is it
      possible?” (www.expressindia.com).<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2">Indian Defence Minister George Farnendas after a
      visit to the Gujrat told the Times of India correspondent that Muslim
      massacre could happen because of the “complete absence of civic
      leadership” and there were “no tall leaders”. Now the big question
      is what made this leadership disappear. Parsa Vankateshwar Raw Jr. in his
      article ‘Stemming communal barbarism: the importance of a new kultur’
      opined that the carnage could happen “because political parties have
      systematically destroyed the moral primacy of the mindless in their desire
      to mobilise mass support (Tehlka. 3 March 2002. <a href="http://www.tehlka.com/channels/commentry/2002/mar/3/com030302beyond.htm"><span style="text-decoration:none;text-underline:none">www.tehlka.com/channels/commentry/2002/mar/3/com030302beyond.htm</span></a>).</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2">Gujrat state government also took a sectarian
      approach by announcing relief and compensation to the victims, Muslims
      half than what the state government is paying to the Hindus, reported The
      Times of India. (7 March 2002). Is it not the Indian version of the New

      <p class="MsoBodyText2">It is very difficult to describe in words the
      mental condition of the victimized Muslims of Gujrat. Frontline columnist

      <p class="MsoBodyText2">Why the Muslims of Gujrat have been made the
      victim of horrendous brutality? Why is this widespread systematic
      destruction of Muslim social, cultural, educational and religious
      institutions? Bohras, Khojas and Memons community of the Muslims who are
      very peaceful non-political entrepreneurs mainly inhabit Gujrat. The
      Muslims of Gujrat made significant progress in business and industry.
      Perhaps the orthodox Hindu leadership wants to bring about the economic
      extermination of the Muslims of the state of Gujrat and therefore this
      organized and most horrible ethnic cleansing of colossal scale to make
      Muslims systematically paralysed and pauperized. In Surat and Ahmedabad
      over 60 factories owned by the Muslims have been completely gutted. In
      other cities, all big and small commercial establishments have been
      looted. Now organized Hindu hoodlums and goons are preventing banks from
      extending loans to the affected Muslim businessmen and industrialists.
      Vinay Menon reported in the Hindustan Times that Hindu activist are
      conducting a sinister survey to identify Muslim students from rich,
      educated Muslim families just to ensure their drop out creating
      psychological fear with the objective to clear educational institutions of
      all Muslim students.<o:p>

      letter to the Indian President K. R. Narayan blamed the Gujrat government
      led by Hindu hardliner BJP for doing “too little too late”. She blamed
      the BJP leadership for making Gujrat Muslims “human bonfire” and for
      the “motivated, well-planned and provocative actions”.<o:p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText2">India can overcome such a situation if it is led
      by such leaders like Jayprokash Narayan and Morarji Desi otherwise it is
      bound to disintegrate, commented Luke Harding (Police took part in
      slaughter. The Observer. 3 March 2002). The same view is also held by
      Saudi daily Arab News Chief Editor Khaled al-Maeena whose opinion is that
      unless common sense prevails over ideological bigotry and fascism and
      India gives up the policy of physically eradicating Muslims and their
      cultural and economic base, as a consequence it might result in “undoing
      of India”.<span style="mso-spacerun:

      <p class="MsoBodyText2">Former Chief of the Indian Navy L. Ramdas in an
      open letter to the Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee has
      condemned the anti-Muslim violence in India describing it as genocide and
      a “program”. Ramdas demanded that Chief Minister of Gujrat be
      dismissed for his involvement in the anti-Muslim riot and a ban on
      “extremist rightwing organization like the VHP and the RSS”. Arun R
      Swamy writing in the Asian Times (5 April 2002) accused that the national
      government did not use its constitutional authority to take over the
      state’s administration on law and order ground as both the union and
      state governments are headed by the same Party, the BJP. Indian Prime
      Minister Atal Brhari Vajpayee’s refusal to dismiss the Gujrat government
      “to restore faith among the Muslims”, as a matter of confidence
      building of the minority Muslim community and then to describe the Gujrat
      carnage as “a disgrace to the nation” and “a bolt on the country’s
      face” is indeed nothing but “shedding crocodile tears and talk big”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>How could there be confidence building between Hindus and Muslim in
      India when “Indian Muslims continue to be viewed as a drag on Indian’s
      progress, as an alien community, intolerant, aggressive and uncompromising
      ready to break but not willing to bend, prepared to rot in their ghettos
      but refusing to adjust to the changing requirement”. “The trouble with
      the Muslims is that they have ceased to be dominant power and have become
      the subjugated community; their erstwhile subjects have become the rulers
      who have no sympathy or consideration for them. The result is that every
      action of a Muslim is criticised, every move condemned; every reaction
      misunderstood, and the whole community is damned for either the fault of a
      few or the indifference of the many”.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2">What has happened in Gujrat is absolutely
      distressing and must be condemned in strongest possible terms. Now the
      question is what the OIC member countries can do to stop massacre of the
      Indian Muslims. OIC can put pressure on India to stop this most brutal and
      systematic ethnic cleansing of the Muslims through diplomatic channel. OIC
      and individual Muslim countries can warn India that unless it stops the
      barbaric killing of the Muslims, they are going to boycott Indian products
      and stop imports from India. Arab Muslim countries and South Asian Muslim
      countries can warn India that unless India stops the massacre of the
      Muslims they are going to expel Indian nationals working in their
      countries. Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. Mahatir Mohammad otherwise so
      vocal to protect Muslim interest (he in the past played very important
      role to protect the interest of the Bosnian Muslim and was much vocal on
      the issue) did not say a single word on the killing of the Muslims in
      Gujrat. Malaysia has a good trade relation with India and a decision by
      Malaysia to suspend trade relation with India unless terrorist attack on
      the Gujrati Muslim is stopped could bring an immediate end to their
      suffering. Oil rich Arab countries and Indonesia can warn India that they
      will stop selling oil to India unless she stops mass murder of Indian
      Muslims and mass destruction of their properties. Arab and Muslim
      countries can jointly put pressure on India through the U.N. to end the
      bloodbath of the Indian Muslims. In fact OIC members can raise the issue
      in U.N. Security Council and General Assembly and demand U.N.
      investigation of the killing of Muslims in Gujrat. Saudi Arabia being the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">khadem</i>
      of the two holy mosques, the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">ummah</i>
      naturally expects much from them. A firm declaration from Riyadh would
      have enabled India to feel the pulse of the Muslim World and would have
      brought an end to the miseries of the Indian Muslims. But all this will
      not suffice unless Muslims governments take effective measures to
      strengthen OIC particularly by electing a Secretary General of the high
      stature of Tenku Abdur Rahman, the late Malaysian Prime Minister.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2">India should be asked to ban all terrorist
      organizations, which are operating under the cover of religious and
      socio-cultural programmes. Writer Arundhati Roy who in the recent past has
      been imprisoned for fighting to preserve environment told the British
      newspaper that while President of Pakistan Gen. Pervez Musharraf was
      dealing with his fundamentalists, here in India they are given “a free
      rein”, Hasan Suroor reported in an article in the Hindu (A view of India
      from Britain. 23 March 2002). This situation cannot be allowed to
      continue. Keeping in view of the experience of the last fifty years of
      repeated communal violence in India and the partisan role of predominantly
      Hindu police force and its failure to play impartial role to protect the
      lives, honour and property of the Muslims, India should be asked to raise
      Special Riot Police Force with equal representation of both Hindus and
      Muslims for that can ensure peace and harmony between different
      communities in India.</p>

          ‘Gujrat program’ 90 percent belongs to the Muslim community
          although it is the Hindus who masterminded the Muslim massacre in
