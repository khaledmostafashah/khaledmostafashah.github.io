      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">In my article ‘Islam and Democracy: 
      How far Compatible’ published in The New Nation on 11 March 2006 I 
      discussed&nbsp; the question of women’s participation as the head of an Islamic 
      government or head of an Islamic state and argued that in today’s world 
      rulers are parts of an establishment. Indeed the government itself is one 
      of a group of institutions that share out among itself the power and 
      authority, which used to be <i>exercised by a single ruler</i>, regardless 
      of the title he assumed. During the earlier days of Islam, the 
      Kholafa-e-Rashadeen <i>used to combine in them comprehensive and broad 
      authority, over the whole Muslim world</i> which no ruler is expected to 
      exercise in foreseeable future, including leading prayers, commanding 
      armies, exercising absolute Ijtihad in Fiqh, and being the supreme judge. 
      From the point of view of her competence, a woman may be assigned some of 
      these powers, including the post of the head of the state, because none of 
      these powers, including that of head of the state, constitute the <i>
      overall authority</i> over the community, which assigns it to a woman. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Moreover no present-day Islamic 
      constitution of any Muslim country has given all these powers to a single 
      person. There is also no obligation in the Quran and Sunnah that all these 
      powers must be vested to a single person. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">In modern state, it is institutions 
      that rule, not individuals. Women, whatever their number in executive, 
      legislative or judiciary positions are included in bodies and are subject 
      to a system. Laws are codified, and discretionary decisions are subject to 
      be reviewed by those who have higher positions or by the courts. No single 
      man or woman can maintain absolute power in modern state. A woman has the 
      right to vote, to be a member of parliament, a minister, a judge, and even 
      an officer in the army. Which jobs may or may not be convenient should be 
      decided by women themselves- not imposed on them- according to their own 
      conviction and based on their own interests. But many traditional Islamic 
      leaders are reluctant to accept this position. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Mr. Mohammad Sakhi under the 
      heading ‘Islam and Democracy’ responded to my article that was published 
      in The New Nation on 17 April 2006. He without refuting the argument put 
      forwarded in favor of woman participation as the head of an Islamic 
      government or head of an Islamic state in my article (as also mentioned 
      briefly in the aforementioned paragraphs), quoted four narrations of the 
      Hadith of Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be on him) without quoting 
      their sources. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">The first Hadith quoted by Mr. 
      Mohammad Sakhi is ‘a nation which entrusts its affairs with women cannot 
      prosper’. &nbsp;In my previous article I raised question on the authenticity of 
      this particular Hadith narrated by Abi Bakra. The scholars of Hadith have 
      classified this Hadith as Ahad Hadith meaning Hadith whose authenticity is 
      not beyond question and this Hadith is Zanni in nature meaning that the 
      Hadith has no established interpretation and whatever interpretation is 
      given will be of speculative in nature. Ahad Hadith is generally reported 
      by single Companion of the Prophet which did not become well-known in 
      immediate two or three generations, does not give positive knowledge, is 
      of speculative authenticity and therefore fall under the category of 
      speculative proofs.&nbsp; Moreover what is established by the Quran cannot be 
      restricted or discarded by Ahad Hadith. Shaykh Taha Jabir Al-Alwani, 
      President of The Fiqh Council of North America and Member of the OIC 
      Islamic Fiqh Council is of the opinion that “the Sunnah is there to 
      clarify the Quran, not to contradict or reject its basic principles” 
      [Issues in Contemporary Islamic Thought, IIIT, U. S. A., 2005, p171]. 
      Tirmizi has classified this Hadith as Hasan Sahih [Hadith No. 2262, Sunan 
      Al Tirmizi, Al Jami Al Sahih, Tahqiq- Mahmud Muhammad Mahmud Hasan Nassar, 
      Kitab Al Fitan, Dar Al Qutb Al Islamiah, Beirut, 2000, p 263]. Narrators 
      of Hadith classified as Hasan Sahih are trustworthy but commit error and 
      the content is not Qati or absolutely correct. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Mr. Mohammad Sakhi&nbsp;&nbsp; quoted two 
      other narrations of the Hadith - (i) ‘<i>when your affairs are in the 
      hands of women then the lap of the earth is better for you then the back 
      of the earth’</i> and (ii) ‘<i>when</i> you see your leaders are immoral 
      and wealthy people are misers and <i>your affairs are entrusted with a 
      woman then remember the lap of the earth is better then the back of the 
      earth’</i>. A closer examination of the aforementioned two narrations of 
      Hadith reveals that both the narrations are English rendering of the same 
      Hadith. Tirmizi has classified this Hadith narrated by Abu Huraira as 
      Gharib, poor [Hadith No. 2266, Sunan Al Tirmizi, Al Jami Al Sahih, Tahqiq- 
      Mahmud Muhammad Mahmud Hasan Nassar, Kitab Al Fitan, Dar Al Qutb Al 
      Islamiah, Beirut, 2000, pp 264-265. Also see Muhammad Sharif Chaudhry, 
      Women’s Right in Islam, Adam Publishers &amp; Distributors, New Delhi, 2003, p 
      167].&nbsp; Such Hadith has been classified as Gharib, poor in whose chain of 
      transmission at one stage the Hadith is reported by one single person only
      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">The fourth Hadith quoted by Mr. 
      Mohammad Sakhi is ‘men have been destroyed when they obeyed the woman’. 
      Scholars have classified this Hadith narrated by Abi Bakra as Daif, weak [Ibn 
      Adi, Kitab ‘Al Kamil Fi Duafa’, p 218/2. Also see www. dorar.net/mhadith.asp].Eminent 
      commentator of Hadith Sheikh Muhammad Nasiruddin Albani also classified 
      this Hadith as Daif, weak [Al Albani, Silsilatul Ahadith Daifa, p 76. Also 
      see www. dorar.net/mhadith.asp]. A Hadith is Daif, weak if among the 
      reporters are any Majhul person, i.e. unknown person in terms of identity 
      or conduct or if there is any Fasiq, violator of any important practice or 
      any liar. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Eminent Islamic scholar Dr. Kaukab 
      Siddique has put forward three arguments in justification that there is no 
      Shariah bar of woman being the head of an Islamic state or the head of an 
      Islamic government. Dr. Siddique referred that Hazrat Ayesha lead the 
      Battle of Camel in which the Sahabas, the Companions of the Prophet 
      followed her. Dr. Siddique dismissed the claim that ‘Ayesha believed she 
      had violated the Quran by going to the Battle of Camel and that she cried 
      when&nbsp; she thought of her mistake’&nbsp; as being “weak and fabricated” [Dr.Kaukab 
      Siddique, The Struggle of Muslim Women, American Society for Education and 
      Religion, INC. 1983, p 46. Bengali tr. Muslim Nareer Sangram, Osder 
      Publications, Dhaka, 2000, p 46].&nbsp; The fact remains that Hazrat Ayesha was 
      in leadership and nobody in the either camps objected to her leadership 
      for being woman. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">The Hadith Bukhari often quoted 
      against the permissibility of women leadership is narrated by Abi Bakra, a 
      Sahabi, Companion of the Prophet. The Hadith reads: ‘Usman ibn al-Haitham 
      reports from Auf, who reports from al-Hasan, who reports from Abi Bakra, 
      who said: In the time of Battle of the Camel, Allah benefited me from this 
      saying: that when the Prophet, peace and blessings be on him, heard that 
      the Persians have made the daughter of&nbsp; Chosroes their King, he (the 
      Prophet) said: that nation will never prosper which puts a woman in 
      command of its affairs [Sahih al Bukhari, Kitabal Fitn, quoted in The 
      Struggle of Muslim Women,&nbsp; p 55. Bengali tr. Muslim Nareer Sangram, p 52]. 
      Dr. Kaukab Siddique pointed out that “if we accept this Hadith as correct 
      it would mean that … Companion of the Prophet quoted the Prophet as saying 
      that a women’s leadership is rejected in Islam, and yet he fought under 
      the command of a woman , and continued to support that woman till the end 
      of his days” [The Struggle of Muslim Women, p 57. Bengali tr. Muslim 
      Nareer Sangram, p 54]. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Indian eminent Islamic scholar 
      Muhammad Sharif Chaudhury wrote: “In fact there is no verse or injection 
      in the Holy Quran which directly or clearly either permits the rule of 
      woman or prohibits her rule. Similarly there is no Hadith or injunction of 
      the Prophet (peace be upon him) which can be quoted to establish that the 
      Holy Prophet either allowed the woman to become head of the state or 
      government or disallowed and forbade her to assume such responsibilities. 
      The Tradition of the Prophet Muhammad about Kisra’s daughter who was 
      enthroned by the Persians, is believed by many to be unreliable and 
      unauthentic as the reporter of this Tradition was convicted and punished 
      in a case of Hudood and his evidence is not dependable. Thus we can safely 
      and without fear of contradiction conclude that that the Quran and Sunnah 
      neither permit nor forbid the woman’s rule” [Women’s Right in Islam, &nbsp;p 
      175].</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Dr. Kaukab Siddique commenting on 
      verse 27: 23, 27: 32 and 27: 44 reiterated that “nowhere does the Quran 
      imply and indicate that Bilqees gave up her rule over the land of Saba 
      after she accepted Islam” [The Struggle of Muslim Women, p 56. Bengali tr. 
      Muslim Nareer Sangram, p 53]. Mr. Mohammad Sakhi, however, quoting Islamic 
      Encyclopedia and Tafsir Ruhul Mani tried to establish that she gave up 
      power. But this is completely speculative as the Holy Quran is silent in 
      this respect. Nor does the authentic Hadith say anything in the matter 
      that the Queen of Sheba left the throne after accepting Islam. The general 
      principle of Islam is that when the Quran and Sunnah do not specifically 
      prohibit a thing or is silent in the matter, we have to take a positive 
      look and consider that permissible and not prohibited anyway [Prof. Dr. 
      Yusuf Al Qaradawi, The Lawful and the Prohibited in Islam, American Trust 
      Publications, U. S. A., p 14. Bengali tr. Islame Halal Haramer Bidhan, 
      Khairun Prokashani, Dhaka, 1999, p 31].</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Dr. Kaukab Siddique quoted the 
      ruling of eminent Islamic scholar Ashraf Ali Thanvi wherein&nbsp; he (Ashraf 
      Ali Thanvi) opined that&nbsp; the Hadith of Abi Bakra in question as discussed 
      earlier “is about autocratic rule by women, not rule by consultation”. 
      Ashraf Ali Thanvi wrote: “In cases like those of Bilqees where a woman 
      rules with the help of an assembly or legislative body, the Hadith from 
      Abi Bakra would not apply. The daughter of the King of Persia was a 
      despotic ruler and hence the Prophet condemned her rule” [Ashraf Ali 
      Thanvi, Imdad al Fatwa, vol. 5, quoted in The Struggle of Muslim Women, pp 
      58-59. Bengali tr. Muslim Nareer Sangram, pp 54-55].</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Muhammad Sharif Chaudhury wrote: 
      “Moulana Ashraf Al Thanvi, a leading scholar of the Islamic world, gave a 
      Fatwa in favor of the rule of Shahjahan Begum, the Queen of Bhopal. The 
      Moulana states that if the government is democratic and the affairs of the 
      state are being conducted by the ruler with the help of elected 
      representatives and in consultation with them, then there is no bar 
      against the woman becoming the head of the state or government. … To 
      justify his view, the Moulana has relied on the reference of the Quran 
      about the rule of Queen of Sheba” [Women’s Right in Islam, p 173]. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">The Government of Saudi Arabia in 
      its Position Paper, highlighting the status, rights and role of the Muslim 
      woman according to the basic sources of Islam, that was presented on the 
      occasion of UN Conference on Woman, Beijing 1995 reiterated that “there is 
      absolutely nothing in the Quran which directly or indirectly forbids a 
      woman to become the head of a state, or even suggests that she is 
      essentially incompetent for the position” [Woman and Family Life in Islam, 
      World Assembly of Muslim Youth, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, First Edition 1995, 
      p 34].&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Muhammad Sharif Chaudhury 
      commented: “The silence of the Quran and Hadith on this very important and 
      vital issue is not without wisdom and sagacity. This deliberate silence 
      means that Islam has given full freedom and discretion to the Muslim Ummah 
      to decide this matter according to the ever changing socio-political 
      circumstances. Since the socio-economic and political environments change 
      with the passage of time effecting the human needs and necessities, no 
      permanent injunctions laying down any hard and fast rules regarding the 
      choice of the ruler or his sex, cooler, race, language or other 
      qualifications have been enunciated by the Quran and Sunnah. The choice 
      has been left open to the Muslim community to decide according to their 
      needs in the prevailing circumstances as to who should be their Amir or 
      chief. Islam favors the form of government by consultation which in the 
      modern jargon is called democratic form of government. In this form of 
      government the people are free to elect anybody who, they feel, would be 
      able to discharge the responsibilities of the highest office of the chief 
      executive or head of the state. The ruler in Islam is not a despot, 
      autocrat or dictator. He is to rule in consultation with others. So the 
      ruler may be a man or a woman, he or she is to discharge duties of the 
      office with the consultation and advice of the elected representatives of 
      the people” [Women’s Right in Islam, pp 175-176]. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Muhammad Sharif Chaudhury further 
      elaborated: “The Quran condemns in open and unambiguous terms the rule of 
      Pharaoh of Egypt who was a man, but it does not express even a slight 
      disapproval of the rule of the Queen of Sheba who was a woman. So it is 
      not the sex of the ruler which is important, but it is in fact the nature 
      and sprit of the rule which is significant. Circumstances may arise for 
      the Muslim Ummah when the benevolent and democratic rule of a woman like 
      Queen of Sheba may be preferable to the despotic and tyrannical rule of a 
      man like Pharaoh of Egypt. Pages of history bear witness to the fact that 
      women became rulers in the Muslim world like Razia, daughter of Sultan 
      Iltutmash, in India in thirteenth century. Shajrat-ul-Darr, daughter of 
      King Najam-ud-Din, in Egypt in thirteenth century, Chand Bibi in southern 
      part of India in sixteenth century, Sutt-ul-Mulk, daughter of caliph Al-Aziz 
      Billah, in Egypt in eleventh century A.D. and Queen Shahjahan Begum of 
      Bhopal in India in early twentieth century. Their rule was never opposed 
      by any of the well known ulama of their age, neither any of the 
      contemporary jurists, scholars or leading ulama gave a Fatwa declaring 
      their rule Haram (unlawful) on the basis of their sex. On the other hand, 
      some ulama gave Fatwas to justify their rule, e.g., in case of Queen of 
      Bhopal, Moulana Ashraf Ali Thanvi gave a Fatwa favoring her rule. However, 
      we can easily find many examples in history when the scholars of Islam and 
      the Ulama vehemently opposed some male rulers because of their tyrannical 
      and despotic rule. Only recently we have seen in Pakistan that most of the 
      leading ulama supported the candidature of a woman for the highest post of 
      the President of Pakistan in the elections of 1964” [Women’s Right in 
      Islam, p 176]. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Amina Wadud, Professor of Islamic 
      Studies, Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies, Virginia 
      Commonwealth University writes: “The Quran uses no terms that imply that 
      the position of ruler is inappropriate for a woman. On the contrary, the 
      Quranic story of Bilqis celebrates both her political and religious 
      practices. … I decide no case until you (advice me on it) [Verse 27: 32]. 
      … The Quran does not restrict the female from being in authority, either 
      over other women or over both women and men. However, there is implication 
      that the Quran inclines towards seeing necessary tasks fulfilled in 
      society in most efficient manner [Quran and Woman: Reading the Sacred Text 
      from a Woman’s Perspective, Oxford University Press, New York, 1999, pp 
      40, 89]. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Dr. Zeenath Kausar, Assistant 
      Professor of Political Science, Kulliyah of Islamic Revealed Knowledge and 
      Human Sciences, International Islamic University, Malaysia commenting on 
      the verse 4: 34 al-rijal qawwamuna ala al-nisa mentioned that this “verse 
      is confined to the family and therefore cannot be extended to the 
      political field” [Political Participation of Women: Contemporary 
      Perspectives of Gender Feminists &amp; Islamic Revivalists, published by A.S. 
      Noordeen, Kuala Lumpur, 1997, p 30]. She wrote: [Basically] “arguments 
      against women’s political participation, in particular, and public 
      participation, in general, are supported either by narrow interpretations 
      of Islamic texts or invalid generalizations” [ibid p 19]. The statement by 
      the Muslim Brotherhood of Egypt on the ‘Role of the Muslim Women in 
      Islamic Society and its Stand on the Women’s Right to Vote, be Elected, 
      and Occupy Public and Governmental Posts, and Work in General’ commenting 
      on the verse 4: 34 states that this verse is “confined to the family and 
      to matters only concerning the husband and wife relationships” [ibid p 
      70]. A new translation of the verse 4: 34-35 is: Men shall take full care 
      of women with the bounties with which God has favored some of them more 
      abundantly than others, and with what they may spend of their own wealth.

      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Verse 9:71 states: And as for the 
      believing men and believing women, they are the guardians of each other 
      [The Quran, tr. by M. H. Shakir, Goodword Books, New Delhi, India, 2003, 
      p123]. The Arabic word is Awlia. If women are guardians of men, how women 
      can be denied the leadership of the Ummah.&nbsp; In fact the Ulama of Pakistan 
      including Moulana Mawdudi accepted Faitma Jinnah’s nomination as a 
      presidential candidate in 1964 presidential elections [Prof. Dr. Yusuf Al 
      Qaradawi, Priorities of the Islamic Movement in the Coming Phase,

      Shukarno Putri became the president of that country with the support of 
      Islamic parties.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Verse 2: 124 of the Holy Quran is 
      also very significant wherein Prophet Ibrahim prayed to Allah to make 
      imams, leaders from his offspring. Allah replied: My covenant does not 
      extend to those who are unjust. Almighty Allah here did not specify the 
      gender, male or female. In this verse, leadership is a covenant between 
      God and humanity – a covenant that is not extended to those who are unjust 
      or who draw close to injustice [Authority: Divine or Quranic in Shaykh 
      Taha Jabir Al-Alwani’s Issues in Contemporary Islamic Thought, IIIT, U. S. 
      A., 2005, p 281]. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Verse 4: 59, u lil amr min kum - 
      obey those in authority from among you, also did not specify the gender, 
      male or female.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Mr. Mohammad Sakhi’s conjecture 
      that ‘women are physically weak and lack wisdom’, ‘woman’s physical 
      conditions are unsuitable for leadership’ and therefore ‘the Muslim woman 
      is not allowed to become the head of the state or government’ contradicts 
      with verse 95: 4 of the Holy Quran which states that human beings have 
      been created in the best of mould. The question therefore does no arise 
      that women’s intellectual capacity is less than that of men. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Mr. Mohammad Sakhi puts forward 
      arguments, which is not part of my earlier article, to prove his 
      contention that woman leadership is not allowed in Islam and that the 
      Shariah does not permit a woman to become head of the Islamic state or the 
      head of the Islamic government and he mentioned in his article that Allah 
      has sent no woman as Prophet nor made woman Imam of the mosque. He also 
      raised question about the participation of women in the mosque and their 
      placement in the mosque behind the row of men as a proof of women’s 
      secondary role to that of men in social affairs that are connected to 
      leadership.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Dr. Jamal Badawi, eminent Egyptian 
      Islamic scholar and currently Chairman of the Islamic Information 
      Foundation Canada, in response the question ‘why all the prophets were 
      male’ replied: “Islam teaches that prophets are not selected by people and 
      so there is no question of there being male or female bias. Prophets are 
      selected by Allah and He is neither male nor female. Possible reasons for 
      a man always being chosen for this role include the fact that the 
      Prophet’s role is not simply to prophesy, but to go out into the community 
      and combat evil and enjoin goodness, even though he may suffer hurt and 
      abuse by doing so. Thus, he not only leads the believers in their ritual 
      worship, but also may have to lead them in battle. It is inconceivable, 
      therefore, that a woman, perhaps someone who was pregnant, could face up 
      to such duties, indeed, Allah does not select <i>any</i> man to be a 
      prophet – He selects men who have special fortitude”. [Islamic Teachings 
      Course, Islamic Schools Trust, 2 Digswell Street, London N7 8JX, England,

      314].&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Women if not Prophets are the 
      mothers of Prophets although according to some Islamic scholars Hajrat 
      Maryam (peace be on her) was a Prophet as angel Gabriel visited her [Dr.

      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Dr. Jamal Badawi replying another 
      question ‘why women pray behind men’ replied: The Muslim prayer does not 
      simply involve quiet supplication whilst being seated; the salah includes 
      bowing, prostrations and standing therefore, logically, there is only one 
      place where women could be situated when in congregational prayers and 
      that is <i>behind</i> the men. The reason for this is that if they were in 
      front of the men, or standing amongst them (shoulder to shoulder) neither 
      men nor women could perform the prayer without disturbing the 
      concentration which is required for this spiritual communication with 
      Allah. Thus the positioning of the women has nothing to do with status, 
      but is simply a matter of etiquette and modesty” [Islamic Teachings 
      Courses, vol. 3, p 40. Bengali tr. Islami Shikkha Series, p 314].&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt;text-align:justify">I shall 
      now examine the Hadith literature which is often misquoted against women. 
      Eminent Islamic scholar Muhammad Nasiruddin Albani in his book Sifatu 
      Salatin Nabie Minat Taqbire Ilat<i> </i>Taslim Kaannaka Tarahu<i> </i>
      quoted a Hadith from Muslim, Abu Dawud, Ibn Khojaimah in which Prophet is 
      reported to have said: A dog, an ass and a woman interrupt prayer if they 
      pass in front of the believer, interposing themselves between him and the 
      qiblah [Muhammad Nasiruddin Albani, Rasulullahr Namaj, Shatabdi Prokashoni, 
      491/1 Moghbazar Wireless Rail Gate, Dhaka-1217, 1998, p 45]. This Hadith 
      seems to aim at placing women behind men during prayer. Hazrat Ayesha, 
      mother of the believers, however contradicted this Hadith saying: You 
      compare us now to asses and dogs. In the name of God, I have seen the 
      Prophet saying his prayers while I was there, lying on the bed between him 
      and the qiblah and in order not to disturb him, I did not move [Fatima 
      Mernissi, The Veil &amp; The Male Elite: A Feminist Interpretation of Women’s 
      Rights in Islam, Perseus Books, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1991, p 70]. She 
      criticized the lumping together of women with dogs and donkeys which she 
      regarded as insult on the person and personality of women. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt;text-align:justify">In 
      another Hadith the Prophet is reported to have said:&nbsp; The better rows for 
      men are front ones, and the worst are the last ones. The better rows for 
      women are the last ones and the worst are the first ones. This Hadith 
      however does not clearly prohibit women from the mosque and only seeks to 
      place women behind men in prayers and not intended to prevent women from 
      praying next to men in most crowded mosque. This Hadith also need to be 
      reconciled with another Hadith in which the Prophet is reported to have 
      said: The first rows [of the prayers] were perceived as superior, 
      specially the first one, for God and the angles bless the first row and 
      the first few rows. To interpret this Hadith in a way that goes against 
      the principle of human equality as enshrined by Islam cannot be acceptable 
      for this is against the very spirit of Islam and principle of natural 
      justice of which Islam is exponent. Prophet in all fairness cannot deny 
      blessings to women keeping them in the rear rows. In fact some scholars 
      got confused and compared the best rows with the prayer rows. In fact the 
      Hadith has been explained in a misplaced context. The best row is the 
      first row of the battle. In other words, the Prophet encouraged women to 
      stay behind the lines during the battles. This becomes clear if the 
      aforementioned Hadith is read together with Quran. Al Quran states: God 
      loves those who fight in His cause in row, as if they were an ordered 
      structure [61: 4]. The problem with this particular Hadith arose as later 
      compiler of Hadith categorized this Hadith with the chapter of prayer, 
      salat.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt;text-align:justify">“That 
      woman is not barred from the mosque is clear from the Hadith in which 
      Prophet is reported to have said: O women. When the men prostrate 
      themselves, then lower your gaze, so you do not see the private parts of 
      the men due to tightness of their loin cloths”. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt;text-align:justify">Al 
      Fanjari cites a tradition showing that a beautiful woman used to pray 
      behind the Prophet and in front of other men. [See al-Hafiz ‘Amad al-Din 
      Abi al-Fida’ Ismail ibn Kathir al-Qurashi al-Dimashqi, Tafsir al-Quran al-Azim 
      (Cairo: Dar Ihya al-Kutub al-Arabiyah), 548-50; and al-Fanjari, Ikhtilat, 
      46, quoted in&nbsp; Women in the Mosque: Historical Perspectives on 
      Segregation, Nevin Reda, American Journal of Islamic Social Sciences, vol. 
      21, no. 2, spring 2004,&nbsp; p 88 ]. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt;text-align:justify">Did any 
      woman lead prayer in which male participated in any point of history. I 
      remember I read a piece by Dr. M. Hamidullah, Director of Islamic Centre 
      Paris, sometimes in 1965-1966 in which he while replying a question by a 
      lady, who came from Muslim family but her husband was a newly reverted 
      Muslim, whether she could lead her husband in prayer for the fact that he 
      has not yet learnt how to offer salah, Dr. Hamidullah replied: yes you can 
      and then he narrated a Hadith. I am quoting Dr. Hamidullah from memory and 
      I don’t have in my possession the material where I read it.&nbsp; According to 
      Hadith Prophet had commanded Umm Waraqah bint Abd Allah ibn al Harith al 
      Ansari to lead people of her area (dar) in prayer. She had her own 
      muadhdin, and she used to lead the people of her area (dar) [Al Banna, 
      Fath, vol. 5, 7:1475-1480, quoted in Nevin Reda, Women in the Mosque: 
      Historical Perspectives on Segregation, American Journal of Islamic Social 
      Sciences, vol. 21, Spring 2004, no. 2, p 91]. The use of muadhdin 
      indicates that she lead prayer in which a good number of Muslims were 
      present.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">The aforementioned Hadith of the 
      Prophet is also recorded in the Hadith Compilation Sunan Abu Dawud which 
      reads: The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) used to visit her (Umm 
      Waraqh daughter of Abd Allah b. al-Harith) at her house. He appointed a 
      muadhdhin to call adhan for her; and he commanded her to lead the inmates 
      of her in prayer. Abd al-Rahman said: I saw her muadhdhin who was an old 
      man. On the basis of this tradition a group of scholars maintain that a 
      woman can act as imam for the people who reside with her in her house, 
      although they include males [The Imamate of Women, Chapter 212, Hadith No. 
      592, note 260, Sunan Abu Dawud, vol. 1, English tr. by Prof. Ahmad Hasan,
