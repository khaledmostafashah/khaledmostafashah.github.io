      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">The New Nation on 11 March 2006 published my 
      article ‘Islam and Democracy: How far Compatible’. The article is the 
      summary of a speech delivered at a seminar organized by the Asian 
      University Bangladesh on 20 February 2006. Keeping in view the parameters 
      of democracy in mind and the unfounded allegations of the western 
      scholars, I discussed several issues in that article. The notable among 
      them: </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Whether the political system of Islam allows 
      autocratic rule or it is based on peoples’ consent and essentially a 
      consultative system; whether this consultation is optional and obligatory? 
      Whether an Islamic state works for group interest or its objective is 
      human welfare? Since the objective of the Islamic state is public welfare 
      and the consultation by the head of the state and government is binding, I 
      concluded in that article that Islamic political system is essentially 
      democratic.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">I also concluded in that article that the authority 
      which shall have the final say in the interpretation of the Text of the 
      Quran is sovereign in the modern sense of this political term, whether it 
      is the Parliament or the Supreme Court or the Council of Elders or the 
      people by referendum.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">I also discussed in that article the question of 
      women’s participation as the head of an Islamic government or head of an 
      Islamic state. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">As a corollary of the women’s political 
      participation and empowerment of the women, I also raised in that article 
      the question whether it is obligatory on the part of the Muslim women to 
      fully cover face or use nikab.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">I also discussed in that article whether Bangladesh 
      is an Islamic state by its constitution and argued in favor of 
      constituting “a committee in the Ministry of Law, Justice &amp; Parliamentary 
      Affairs consisting of eminent Islamic scholars, Ulama, jurists and Fuqaha, 
      Islamic theologians having the essential ability for expounding Islamic 
      law and being an authority thereon, just, virtuous, abreast of time, 
      having political and social insight, judicious and who command and enjoy 
      the trust and confidence of the people. The members of this committee 
      shall examine and review all drafts acts to be passed by Parliament (also 
      all Presidential Ordinances) and give its views on such act(s) to the 
      Government so that parliamentary enactments are not contrary to the tenets 
      and precepts of Islam. The inclusion of such members in the committee will 
      ensure that the Government is being judiciously advised at the drafting 
      stage so that no law repugnant to the Quran and Sunnah comes before the 
      Cabinet or Parliament for consideration”.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Mr. Mohammad Sakhi under the heading ‘Islam and 
      Democracy’ responded to my article that has been&nbsp; published in The New 
      Nation on 17 April 2006 and raised many issues which are new and not 
      connected to what I have discussed in my article. I had no intention to 
      raise a debate afresh on what Mr. Mohammad Sakhi has said in response to 
      my article but for Mr. Mohammad Sakhi’s request that he likes to ‘hear’ 
      from me as mentioned at the concluding paragraph of his article.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">I would like to use the column of The New Nation to 
      thank Mr. Mohammad Sakhi for his valuable comments. In any intellectual 
      discourse there can always be difference of opinion and such differences 
      are not necessarily “error” which Mr. Mohammad Sakhi mentioned in the very 
      first paragraph of his article while commenting on my article. Our earlier 
      scholars differed but then they never said that some one is wrong. Mr. 
      Mohammad Sakhi commented that I have “left out” points in my article. But 
      not covering a certain point in a speech or in a newspaper article or even 
      in a book is not uncommon and there is nothing wrong in it if no 
      suppression of fact has been made<b>. </b>In fact it is not possible for 
      any person to cover all points of an issue in any article.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Mr. Mohammad Sakhi wanted me that I should “expound 
      the authority that shall have the final say in the interpretation of the 
      Text of Quran by ijtihad”. I think I have addressed the issue sufficiently 
      in my article. What I want to add is that there is no meaning of saying 
      that Allah is Sovereign without fully analyzing this concept in its modern 
      connotations. Sovereignty is a new word and it has no exact parallel or 
      equivalent in Arabic or Islamic terminology. Sovereignty is totally a 
      western concept. We can only infer how far Islam is nearer to this concept 
      or to what extent Islam differs with the modern day concept of 
      sovereignty. What I want to say is that Bangladeshi ummah shall have the 
      final say, last word to decide who shall have final authority in the 
      interpretation of the Text of the Quran in Bangladesh. The Bangladeshi 
      ummah through its constitution can exercise it by referendum, or confer it 
      either to the Parliament or the Supreme Court or the duly constituted 
      Council of Elders. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">The preamble of the 1956 Constitution of the 
      Islamic Republic of Pakistan states: “And Whereas the Constituent 
      Assembly, represented by the people of Pakistan, have resolved to frame 
      for the sovereign independent State of Pakistan a constitution”. Look, 
      even the 1956 Constitution of Pakistan, which was accepted by the then all 
      Ulama and Islamic political parties of Pakistan, states that Pakistan is a 
      sovereign state. The preamble at another place states: “Whereas the 
      integrity of the territories of the Federation, its independence and all 
      its rights, including its sovereign rights over land, sea and air should 
      be safeguarded”. That means Pakistan is a sovereign country and it must 
      exercise its sovereign rights over all territories including sea and air.
      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">In this connection what Moulana Motiur Rahman 
      Nizami, Chief of Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh said in his inaugural address 
      at Rukan Conference 2006 on 3 June 2006 is significant. He said: “Jamaat 
      is respectful to the independence and sovereignty of all countries in the 
      light of UN Charter” [Booklet- Inaugural Speech, JIB, Publication 
      Department, Bara Moghbazar, Dhaka, 2006, p 22]. Look, Moulana Motiur 
      Rahman Nizami even departed here from the traditional concept of the 
      Sovereignty of God and making a statement that Jamaat believes in the 
      sovereignty ‘of all other countries’. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">In fact the modern concept of sovereignty is highly 
      complex and technical in nature. According to Austin sovereign power 
      possesses unlimited power, indivisible and a determinate authority. In 
      real practice however there is nothing that can be called unlimited 
      sovereignty in the sense that states actions are externally limited by the 
      other states actions and rights, and internally state’s power is divided 
      between different organs of the state and government namely legislature, 
      executive and judiciary. Powers are even sometimes subject to customs and 
      public opinion. The bureaucracy and the media do exercise powers. 
      Authority is divided and it is not possible to say that one controls the 
      whole because each controls only a part. Each is supreme in its own 
      sphere. Neither can be said to be supreme over the other. Taken all these 
      factors into consideration we can say that state’s powers are internally 
      divided. The state only exists externally, in relation to other states.
      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Allah is Hakim, Command is only for Allah should 
      not therefore be equated with Austin’s concept of sovereignty.&nbsp; Austin did 
      not refer to the Authority of Allah, he was referring to the authority of 
      the ruler. Even in Kholafa-e-Rashadeen, Caliphs issued laws both in 
      written and unwritten form and this did not constitute violation of 
      Hakimat of Allah.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Mr. Mohammad Sakhi has raised a question: ‘Can a 
      Muslim country be called Islamic if it is not run by the divine laws?’ In 
      my previous article I pointed out that our laws, namely the Law of 
      Inheritance, the Law of Endowments and Marriage and Divorce Law are by and 
      large based on Shariah. What I want to add in response to Mr. Mohammad 
      Sakhi is that most of our laws are administrative laws and Allah has given 
      us freedom to legislate in case of Tazir, where the Quran and Sunnah are 
      silent. Punishment under Tazir is called Siyasah al Shariyyah in Islamic 
      Fiqh. Our laws are not against Islam in the sense that these laws contain 
      almost nothing that contradicts the Text of the Quran and the objective of 
      these laws are&nbsp; human welfare and these laws also mostly fall within the 
      category of amr bil maruf wa nahi al munkar- realizing interests and 
      removing evils. Only a few sections have to be amended in some laws, not 
      even all sections of these laws. The constitution of Bangladesh reiterated 
      its absolute trust and faith in Almighty Allah and the state religion is 
      Islam. The two major political parties namely, BNP and Awami League are 
      committed not to frame un-Islamic laws. Everybody in Bangladesh can 
      perform religious rituals. Women can observe Hijab and there is no bar to 
      establish mosque and madrasa. In theory we have Islamic laws in the 
      country although we find lapses in some cases. We observe such lapses 
      during the Umayyad and the Abbasid Caliphates. We can however enact law of 
      blasphemy so that none can dare to criticize Prophets and leaders of other 
      religious faiths. Such a law should contain provision of harsh penalty for 
      the violation. We can also frame law banning the production, storage, 
      carrying, sale, import and drinking of wine and use of other narcotics and 
      the law should have provision for severe punishment for the violation. 
      However we have to keep in mind that as individual Muslim continue to 
      remain a Muslim even after not observing certain principle of Islam, it is 
      not proper and justified to think that a Muslim state loses its Islamic 
      character just for not observing certain provisions of the Shariah. It 
      remains Dar al-Islam, Islamic state in the technical sense despite some 
      deficiencies. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">I want to conclude with the observation that what 
      has been discussed here is not the last word and Allah knows the best. 
      Allah hu alam.</td>
