      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">The West considers itself as being the
      cradle of the modern civilization and the countries of the West are the
      claimant of being the protector, promoter and defender of liberty,
      freedom, equality and fundamental human rights. The West is also very
      proud as being the emancipator of the women although crime and violence
      related to women is significant in number in the West, which is highly
      developed, compared to backward poor countries in other regions of the
      world. The position of the women in the West can be comprehended from the
      behaviour of its leaders towards the women. Let us recall the separation
      of Princess Diana Spencer with Prince Charles, heir apparent of Queen
      Elizabeth II, future figurehead of the Church and father of two kids, for
      being “unfaithful to wife” and maintaining extra-marital relation with
      his mistress Camilla widely known as “Camillagate”. French President
      Mitterrand is reported to have a daughter outside the wedlock. Think about
      the behaviour Senator Hillary Clinton, then US first lady, received from
      her husband President Bill Clinton who maintained illicit sex relation
      with Monica Lewinsky. It was during the presidency of Bill Clinton that
      homosexuality was allowed in the U.S. army. The Christian Church has no
      role and little to say in such matters. Even the Priests are involved in
      sex related crime and scandals. In May- June 2002 media widely covered the
      involvement of Catholic Church in the sexual abuse scandal indicating that
      Priests molested young parishioners and a theology student in U.S.A.
      Australia was engulfed in a U.S. style sex abuse scandal in which a top
      Archbishop is involved. Sex scandal of the Priests rocked the United
      States and embarrassed President George Bush Jr. raised the issue of
      Pedophilia scandal with Pope John Paul when he visited Vatican on 28<sup>th</sup>
      May 2002.<o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Arabic language daily Al
      Quds Al Arabi, London quoting Daily Mirror reported that British man has
      on an average of five extramarital lovers. Alan Clark, defense secretary
      during the Thatcher government publicly admitted that he had slept with
      three generations- a girl, her mother, and her grandmother- in the office
      of the British Defense Ministry. According to F.B.I. report 1990 everyday
      on average 1756 cases of rape were committed in U.S. A subsequent report
      mentioned that everyday on average 1900 cases of rapes are committed in
      U.S.A. Their classmates at student parties rape 87 percent young American
      women in the university during freshman year.<o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The condition of women is
      no better in Third World countries. Xinhua from Kampala reported on 16
      March 2002 that Ugandan Vice President Specioza Wandira Kazibwe separated
      from her husband due to beatings she received from her husband. If this is
      the position of an officiating Vice President of a country, you can
      imagine the place of common women with average background in the society.<o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Now let us look back to
      the state of women in Bangladesh. According to the United Nations
      Population Statistical Report 2001, Bangladesh secured second position
      among the countries of the world for violence against women. How come this
      is the condition of women in Bangladesh, a predominantly Muslim country?
      Indeed the status of women in Islam is very high. The first person who
      accepted Islam is a woman, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">ummul
      muminin</i> Khadija Bint Khuwaylid (may Allah be pleased with her). Women
      if not Prophets are the mothers of the Prophets although according to some
      Islamic scholars Hajrat Maryam (peace be on her) was a Prophet as angel
      Gabriel visited her (Feminism &amp; Islam: Legal and Literary

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">On 1<sup>st</sup> April
      2002<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A.P. from Dubai quoting
      Gulf News reported that Dubai Court of Cassation, the highest Court in the
      United Arab Emirate (U.A.E.) has ruled that ‘a husband has right to beat
      his wife in order to discipline her provided the beatings are not so
      severe that they damage her bones or deform her body’. There must be
      some wrong in our understanding of the relevant verse of the Quran
      otherwise how a court in a Muslim country can rule that a husband has
      right to beat his wife which is against human dignity and the all-purpose
      objective of Islam? The issue therefore needs to be addressed afresh.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">In Islam all human beings,
      men and women, are equal [Al Quran 3(Surat Al Imran):195 and Al Quran
      33(Sura Al Ahzab): 35]. Adam and Eve were created from a single soul [Al
      Quran 4(Surat An Nisa): 1 and Al Quran 7(Surat Al Araf): 189] which
      contradicts the largely held Christian view that Eve was created from the
      rib of Adam and therefore women are inferior to men. Eminent Arab Islamic
      scholar and sociologist of repute Dr. Hammudah Abd al Ati (a former
      Associate Professor of Sociology at Utica College of Syracuse University)
      translated verse 189 of Surat Araf as: It was Allah who created mankind
      out of one living soul, and created of that soul a spouse (The Family
      Structure in Islam. p 55. American Trust Publications, U.S.A. in
      collaboration with Imam Muhammad bin Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi
      Arabia. Edition 1977.). The Islamic belief is that Allah decided to send <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">khalifa</i> or the vicegerent on the earth [Al Quran 2(Surat Al Baqarah):
      30] which contradicts the Christian view that Adam and Eve were expelled
      from the heaven due to the wrong committed by Eve at the instigation of
      the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">iblis</i> or the Satan rather
      the Islamic faith is that both Adam and Eve committed mistake at the
      persuasion and influence of the Satan [Al Quran 2(Surat Al Baqarah): 36
      and Al Quran 7(Surat Al Araf): 20-22]. Human beings have been created in
      the best of mould [Al Quran 95(Sura At Tin): 4]. The question therefore
      does not arise that women’s intellectual capacity is less than that of
      men. Men and women are equal before Allah and they are created from the
      same substance in order to console, to complete and to fulfill each other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>In this connection the comment made by the renowned Egyptian
      Islamic scholar and the greatest Islamic jurist of our time Dr. Yusuf Al
      Qaradawi, Dean of the Faculty of Shariah, Qatar Islamic University worth
      mentioning. Dr. Qaradawi in his book The Status of Women in Islam wrote:
      “With the advent of Islam, circumstances improved for the woman. The
      woman’s dignity and humanity were restored. Islam confirmed her capacity
      to carry out Allah’s commands, her responsibilities and observation of
      the commands that lead to heaven. Islam considered the woman as a worthy
      human being, with a share in humanity equal to that of man. Both are two
      branches of a single tree and two children from the same father Adam and
      mother Eve. Their single origin, their general human traits, their
      responsibility for the observation of religious duties with the consequent
      reward or punishment, and the unity of their destiny all bear witness to
      their equality from the Islamic point of view” (available in website <a href="http://www.witness-pioneer.org/"><span style="text-decoration:none;
text-underline:none">www.witness-pioneer.org</span></a><u>)</u>. If this is the
      status of woman in Islam, how misperceived husband justify the beating of
      wife? There must be some error of in our perception and understanding of
      the revealed text of the Quran and therefore the issue needs to be
      examined anew for the scholars of the earlier generation might have missed
      a point which needs to be clarified. In this connection the Farewell
      Pilgrimage message of Prophet Muhammad (saws) is very pertinent in which
      he (saws) called upon those who are present on the occasion to convey his
      (saws) message to those who are not present adding that those who will
      come to know about his (saws) message later might understand the inner
      meaning and significance of his (saws) message more than who are present
      (Muhammad: Glimpses of the Prophet’s Life &amp; Times. p 200. Zahir
      Ahmed. Royal Book Company,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Karachi,
      Pakistan. Also Muhammad: Seal of the Prophets. p 345. Prof. Syed Ali Ahsan.

      of the Prophetic Biography &amp; A Brief History of the Orthodox
      Caliphate. pp 651-652. Dar Al Fikr, Damascus). Imam Muhammad bin Idris al
      Shafi, the founder of the Shafi School of Thought or <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">madhab</i> had modified and changed many of his earlier views on
      settling in Egypt after leaving Iraq due to changed socio, cultural,
      political and economic condition. (Islam, the West and the Challenges of
      Modernity. p 17. Tariq Ramadhan. The Islamic Foundation, U.K.). Indeed
      time and space is important elements of the Islamic jurisprudence (The
      Quran and the Sunnah: The Time-Space Factor. Taha Jabir al Alwani and Imad
      al Din Khalil. IIIT, U.S.A.). One problem with the scholars of the earlier
      period of Islam is that their understanding of the Quran had been less
      than critical owing to the fact that they stopped at the literal meaning
      of each verse without making serious efforts to compare and reconcile
      verses that seemed to contradict one another. The conceptual confusion
      occurred in the early period of Islam when the classical jurists took the
      text of the Quran for what it appeared to be not for what it was meant to
      be. The mere repetition of out dated interpretations and sterile thinking
      has however failed to bring about desired social changes or to put an end
      to the prevailing cultural conflict and tension.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The development in the
      field of science and technology has however brought to light newer and
      deeper meanings of the revealed text which in many ways differs from the
      earlier interpretations. Information technology has also made more
      information easy accessible to the scholars of this generation which was
      not readily available to the academics and researchers of the earlier
      generation. This has also helped the scholars of this generation to a
      great extent to draw new <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">ijtihad.</i><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The broad objective of
      Islam is to establish peace. One of the meanings of ‘Islam’ is peace.
      Islam is committed to establish peace not only at the global level, to
      establish solidarity and brotherhood at the level of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">ummah
      </i>and to establish unity and cohesion in the state and society but also
      deeply committed to promote harmony in the family. The objective of the
      conjugal relation is to ensure love and compassion between the spouses [Al
      Quran 30 (Sura Ar Rum): 21], avoid conflict and tension in the family and
      to ensure balanced growth of the children as responsive citizens with firm
      faith competent to face the challenge of the new millennium. Women not
      only best understand the needs of the family and act as the main
      transmitters of the culture and values to the children. They bring
      different perspective to life. But beating of the wife by the husband can
      in no way promote understanding and kindness between husband and wife but
      would increase hatred, friction and bitterness in the already acrid
      relationship. In such situation the family cannot play any constructive
      and meaningful role for the development of the society for a bird cannot
      fly with one wing only. In fact a couple having intimate relations is for
      humanity what the sun for the nature is. How then the scholars of the
      earlier generation justified beating of the wife by the husband which
      contradicts the general objective of Islam for maintaining peace, harmony
      and tranquility in the family? Moreover, the matrimonial union is Islam is
      an agreement by choice and the relationship can be terminated by judicious
      use of free will and there is no question of coercion.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The most misunderstood
      verse of the Quran which has been interpreted by the scholars of the
      earlier generation that justify the beating of the wife by the husband is
      4 (Surat An Nisa): 34-35 and the Arabic root verb is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">daraba</i>.
      To arrive at the clear meaning of the verse of the Quran we shall try to
      reconcile the verses of the Quran and try to explain one verse of the
      Quran with the help of another verse of the Quran for that is the most
      methodical approach of the interpretation of the Quran. We shall then
      refer to the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">seerah</i> or the life
      of the Prophet Muhammad (saws) for necessary guidance in this matter. We
      shall also examine the literal and etymological meaning of the word <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">daraba</i> in its different derivatives as appeared in various verses of
      the Quran.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">To grasp the precise
      meaning of the verse of the Quran we shall use English rendering of the
      Quran by Abdullah Yusuf Ali, Marmaduke Pikthall; Muhammad Asad, Sayyid
      Qutub, T. B. Irving<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>and joint
      English translation of the meaning of the noble Quran by Dr. Muhammad
      Muhsin Khan and Dr. Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">We shall now quote the
      most misunderstood verse of the Quran, which has been used for cruelty
      against women. Abdullah Yusuf Ali translated verse 34-35 of Surat An Nisa
      is as: Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has
      given the one more (strength) than the other, and because they support
      them from their means. Therefore the righteous women are devoutly
      obedient, and guard in (the husband’s) absence what Allah would have
      them guard. As to those women on whose part you fear disloyalty and
      ill-conduct, admonish them (first), (next) refuse to share their beds,
      (and last) beat them (lightly) [Arabic word used in the verse is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">wadribuhunna</i>];
      but if they return to obedience seek not against them means (of
      annoyance): for Allah is Most High, Great (above you all).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>If you fear a breach between them twain, appoint (two) arbiters,
      one from his family, and the other from hers; if they seek to set things
      aright, Allah will cause their reconciliation; for Allah has full
      knowledge, and is acquainted with all things [Al Quran 4 (Surat An Nisa):
      34-35] (The Holy Quran: English translation of the Meanings and
      Commentary. pp 219-220. Revised &amp; Edited by The Presidency of the
      Islamic Research, IFTA, Call and Guidance. King Fahd Holy Quran Printing
      Complex. Saudi Arabia.).</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">If one closely reads and
      examines the aforementioned verse of the Quran keeping in view overall
      spirit of the matrimonial relationship of mutual love, affection and
      fellow feeling between the spouses and inbuilt structure of family on
      compassion and benevolence, one must necessarily conclude that intolerant
      attitude of the husband like recourse to beating the wife cannot be a way
      for continuation of peaceful and harmonious conjugal life rather such
      cruel attitude of the husband is bound to create mutual suspicion and
      promote mistrust<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>among the
      partners that might ultimately result in the disintegration and breakup of
      the family. Moreover, if the third step to resolve marital dispute is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">daraba</i>,
      translated as beating as mentioned in the verse quoted above, the fourth
      step cannot be arbitration for if the husband take the extreme step of
      beating wife, the arbiters will have little scope for mediation. Logic
      also suggests that the spouses would also naturally prefer to keep their
      differences secret to avoid disgrace, embarrassment and humiliation in
      front of the society unless they take the farthest step for divorce. What
      then is the inner meaning of the word <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">daraba</i>
      which is an instrument to bring about reconciliation and peace between the
      enraged spouses? Although the English translation of the word <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">wadribuhunna</i>
      (root verb being <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">daraba</i>) has
      been made as beat them lightly, the word lightly is not mentioned in the
      revealed text of the verse quoted above and therefore the question of
      beating wife by the husband does not arise irrespective of the level and
      degree of the beating if the husband is keen and really interested in the
      continuation of the marriage.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Now if we read the
      aforementioned verse [Al Quran 4 (Surat An Nisa):34-35] together with 2 (Surat
      Al Baqarah): 231 wherein the husband has been advised not to take back
      wife to injure, it becomes clear that the meaning of the word <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">daraba
      </i>cannot be beating. Al Quran states: When you divorce women and they
      (are about to) fulfill the term of their (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">iddat</i>),
      either take them back on equitable terms or set them free on equitable
      terms, but do not take them back to injure them … [Al Quran<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>2 (Surat Al Baqarah): 231]. Again in verse 33 (Sura Al Ahzab):
      49 Allah has ordained husbands to release wives in a graceful manner. Al
      Quran states: … give them a present and release them in a handsome
      manner [Al Quran 33 (Sura Al Ahzab): 49]. In another verse Al Quran
      states: … The parties should either hold together on equitable terms or
      separate with kindness … [Al Quran 2 (Surat Al Baqarah): 229]. If
      separation between the spouses has to be made with grace and kindness, how
      the basis of reconciliation of disputes between the husband and wife can
      be beating?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is therefore
      evident from the above comparative study of the verses of the Quran that
      the meaning of the idiom <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">daraba</i>,
      which is an instrument of reconciliation of marital disputes, cannot be
      beating of wife by the husband. Further, women are the embodiment of
      beauty, by nature emotional and fragile and therefore question of
      resorting to beating wife by husband to resolve rupture and rift in
      conjugal life does not arise.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Does the word <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">daraba</i>
      then signify any allegorical, metaphorical or symbolic meaning beyond its
      literal and etymological connotation? Now if we fall back to the life of
      the Prophet Muhammad (saws) as to what he (saws) did to resolve his (saws)
      differences with his (saws) wives. There is no record that Prophet (saws)
      ever slapped, beat, stroke or punched any of his (saws) wives. “Never
      did the Prophet (saws) raise his (saws) hand to any of his (saws) wives;
      all the testimonies show him (saws) as attentive and respectful to the
      person and the personality of the women who surrounded him (saws)”
      (Islam, the West and the Challenges of Modernity. p 341 Tariq Ramadhan).
      Prophet (saws) “not only did never raise his (saws) hand to strike any
      of his wives, but he (saws) condemned wife-beating” (Feminism &amp;
      Islam: Legal and Literary perspectives. p 312). Famita Mernissi , a
      sociologist of international reputation and a teacher at the University of
      Mohammad, Rabat, Morocco in her book The Veil and The Male Elite: A
      Feminist Interpretation of Women’s Rights in Islam wrote: “The Prophet
      never raised his hand against one of his wives … The only time when the
      Prophet was confronted with a domestic revolt, a rebellion by some of his
      wives, not only did he not beat them, but he preferred to leave his home
      and, to the great surprise of the city, to move for almost a month to a
      room adjoining the mosque”(The Veil and The Male Elite: A Feminist
      Interpretation of Women’s Rights in Islam. pp 156-157. Fatima Mernissi.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Perseus Books, Cambridge, Massachusetts).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Who else knew more than Prophet (saws), who (saws) is the official
      interpreter of the Quran [Al Quran16 (Surat Al Nahl): 44], the meaning and
      significance of the instruction of this verse? Prophet (saws) understood
      the implication and spirit of the verse and therefore he (saws) did not
      resort to beating. What Prophet Muhammad (saws) did is that he (saws)
      resorted to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">al-mashrabah</i>, moved
      away from his residential quarters for a month or so without inflicting
      any physical injury to enable the noble ladies ponder and try to
      understand the consequences of living in isolation from the husband, the
      mental pain and agony which a wife has to experience in the absence of the
      husband and realize the gravity and seriousness of recalcitrance and
      defiance. The most candid meaning of the root verb <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">daraba</i>
      in the dialect and language of the Quran therefore implies and signifies
      to “leave”, to “moving away”, to “separate” (Chastising Women:
      A Means to Resolve Marital Problems. Eminent Saudi intellectual Dr.
      AbdulHamid AbuSulayman, President, International Institute of Islamic
      Thought (IIIT), USA and formerly Rector of International Islamic
      University, Malaysia. Original article in Arabic and translated into
      English by Dr. Mazen A. Al Najjar). It is significant that the text of the
      Quran does not use the word <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">daraba</i>
      to denote physical or corporal punishment rather the Quran uses <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">jalada</i>
      (to lash, to whip, to flog etc). Al Quran states: The woman and the man
      guilty of fornication flog each of them with a hundred stripes …<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">We shall now have a
      glimpse over the whole Quran and identify the verses of the Quran where
      the word <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">daraba</i> has appeared in
      the Quran with its different meanings, connotations and derivatives in all
      seventeen distinct nuances or representations. The idiom <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">daraba</i>
      in the land denotes to travel or to depart [Al Quran 4 (Surat An Nisa):
      101. Arabic word used in the verse is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">waiza</i>
      <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">darabtum</i>]. With respect to ear,
      the verb <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">daraba</i> means to block

      as explained by Dr. AbdulHamid AbuSulayman and quoted above, the meaning
      of the verse becomes: Men are the protectors and maintainers of women,
      because Allah has given the one more (strength) than the other, and
      because they support them from their means. Therefore the righteous women
      are devoutly obedient, and guard in (the husband’s) absence what Allah
      would have them guard. As to those women on whose part you fear disloyalty

      qawwamuna ala al-nisa</i> [Al Quran 4 (Surat An Nisa): 34-35 quoted above]
      commonly mistranslated as man is the leader of woman, man is superior or
      placed higher than woman, man is placed above woman, man is the director
      of woman, man has authority over woman, man has right to supervise woman
      etc. Marmaduke Pikthall translated the verse as ‘men are in charge of
      women’. Some even translated the verse as: men are the governors of the
      women. Such translation is against the basic tenets and precepts of Islam.
      Islam does not permit any one to rule over another. No power other than
      Allah Almighty can rule over human beings. Men are not permitted to rule
      over women or women over men. When a judge issues judgment all he is doing
      is implementing Law of Allah. In their joint translation of the noble
      Quran Dr. Muhammad Muhsin Khan and Dr. Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Post-modernist Islamic

      against the general principle of equality of men and women.<span style="mso-spacerun:

      Hofmann thinks that such interpretation of the verse of the Quran is
      creating obstacle on the way of the progress of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">dawah</i>,
      Islamic call and guidance, in the West. “No other factor is harming the
      chances of Islamic <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">dawah</i> as much
      as the occidental assessment that women in Islam are second class
      citizens, marginalized, suppressed and mummified. The trouble is that this
      assessment is not without foundation because Muslim women in many parts of
      <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">dar al Islam</i> are still deprived
      of their Quaranic rights and status. In other words: Many Muslim women are
      still living much as they did during the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">jahiliyah.</i>
      It is therefore from these <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">jahiliyah</i>
      practices that they must be emancipated. … It is vital … to contradict
      the misconception concerning women in Islam. Otherwise Islamic <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">dawah</i> in the West is almost hopeless” (Islam 2000. pp 44-45. Murad
      Hofmann. amana publications. Maryland).In this connection the remarks made
      by Tariq Ramadhan, Professor of Philosophy and Islamic Studies, University
      of Fribourg, Switzerland is very significant. He said: “The notion of
      the chief of the family who alone decides for, and sometimes against, the
      rest of the family … those cultural habits of a certain number of
      countries with Muslim majorities that attribute to Islam attitudes which
      in fact Islam reprobates” (Islam, the West and the Challenges of
      Modernity. p 38 Tariq Ramadhan). The belief that in essence, in attributes
      and in conception, men are superior to women is so deep-rooted that even
      some women came to believe that they are defective. “Such beliefs have
      little to do with Islam but are products of historical process that not
      only pre-date Islam but gained momentum after the death of Prophet (saws)
      due to socio-political realities of the time” (Feminism &amp; Islam:
      Legal and Literary Perspective’. p 295).<o:p>

      noteworthy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He pointed out:
      “The[se] male tendencies and the appending customs and ways are manifest
      in many societies where male arbitrariness runs amok with no religious or
      human limitation”.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">“Take, for instance, the
      Arab, Persian and Indian societies. Although the message of Islam has
      spread in these societies from early times, the teaching and inculcation
      of Islamic cultural values was not coextensive with the horizontal
      expansion. Consequently some pre-Islamic values and prejudices have
      continued to persist despite the domination of Islamic forms. In some
      cases there was manifest historical religious decline and relapse to the
      earlier social ethos and mores”.<o:p>

      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">“This phenomenon has
      sometimes occasioned an even more serious development. New or degenerate
      Muslim societies would sometimes, out of ignorance, attribute their
      un-Islamic legacy or custom to Islam itself. By attaching an Islamic value
      to these practices they seek to give them legitimacy and sanctity, the
      values of Islam being accepted as sacred and supreme. This explains the
      unabated influence on the minds of many otherwise good Muslims of
      attitudes abhorrent to Islam, especially in the sensitive areas of sex
      relations where passion is strong and custom is sacrosanct” (Women in

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Tariq Ramadhan further
      commented: “In the final analysis one must acknowledge that the

      not only with regard to Western values but equally in the light of points
      of reference that are strictly Islamic” (Islam, the West and the

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Commenting on the verse
      Murad Hofmann wrote: “If Muslims throughout history had not adopted the
      Quran to their macho instincts but, on the contrary, had adopted their
      behaviour to the Quran, women would not have become what can be seen in
      some places as second class citizens. In particular, it has never been
      justified to translate <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">al-rijal
      qawwamuna ala al-nisa </i>as instituting<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">
      </i>male superiority<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">. </i>This
      sentence does no more than oblige men to take care of women, with full
      responsibility, inasmuch as the women needs it and her husband is capable
      of it. Man is not a step above her, but moves protectively a step in front
      of her” (On the Role of Muslim Intellectuals. p 71. Murad Wilfried

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">T.B. Irving translated the
      verse [Al Quran 4 (Surat An Nisa): 34-35] as:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>“men are the ones who should support women”. The celebrated
      commentator of the Quran Muhammad Asad translated the verse as: “men
      shall take full care of the women”. Explaining the justification of the
      translation of the verse Mohammad Asad commented: “The grammatical form <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">qawwam</i> is more comprehensive… and combines the concepts of
      physical maintenance and protection as well as of moral responsibility:
      and it is because of the last named factor that I have rendered this
      phrase as “men shall take full care of women” (The Message of The
      Quran. p109. Note 42. Translated and Explained by Muhammad Asad. Dar Al
      Andalus Limited, Gibraltar). Sayyid Qutub translated the verse as: “Men
      shall take full care of women with the bounties with which God has
      favoured some of them more abundantly than others, and with what they may
      spend of their own wealth” (In The Shade Of The Quran. p 112 Vol. III.
      Sayyid Qutub. English rendering by Adil Salahi and Ashur Shamis. The
      Islamic Foundation, U.K.). Commenting on the verse Sayyid Qutub pointed
      out: “God has created human beings as males and females, following the
      dual rule, which is central to the system of creation. He has given the
      woman the great tasks of childbearing, breast-feeding and looking after
      her children. These are not tasks, which can be fulfilled without careful
      preparation, physically, psychologically, and mentally. It is only just
      therefore that the other part, i.e. the man, should be assigned the task
      of providing the essential needs and the protection required for the woman
      to fulfill her highly important duties. … the Quran states that in
      Islamic society men are required to look after women. It is an assignment
      of duties on the basis of natural abilities and the fair distribution of
      responsibilities. Each party is assigned the duties most suited to its
      nature” (ibid pp 131-132). The implication of the verse is that men are
      to protect women as long as they need and desire protection. Eminent
      Egyptian Islamic thinker, journalist and educational reformer Dr. Fathi
      Osman translated the verse as: “Men, take full care of women, for what
      God has granted some of them distinctively from the other, and what they
      may spend out of their possessions”. Explaining the verse Dr. Osman
      commented: “The distinctiveness between man and women is related to the
      woman’s pregnancy, delivery, and nursing, which make it necessary that
      the man should have the responsibility to provide for her needs and the
      needs of the children, at least when she is hindered with such a
      distinctive function, that of reproduction” (Rethinking Islam and
      Modernity. p 44. Edited by Abdelwahab El-Affendi. The Islamic Foundation,
      U.K.).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Writing on the issue
      Dr. Gamal A. Badawi, Chairman of the Islamic Information Foundation,
      Halifax, Canada and an outstanding Islamic scholar who is actively
      involved in spreading the message of Islam in the West commented: “In
      consideration of the physiological and psychological make-up of man and
      woman, both have equal rights and claims on one another, except for one
      responsibility, that of leadership. This is a matter which is natural in
      any collective life and which is consistent with the nature of man. … [<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">qawwamuna</i>]
      refers to the natural difference between the sexes which entitles weaker
      sex to protection. It implies no superiority or advantage before the law.
      Yet, man’s role of leadership in relation to his family does not mean
      the husband’s dictatorship over his wife. Islam emphasizes the
      importance of taking counsel and mutual agreement in family decisions [as
      mentioned in verse 233 of the Surat Al<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Baqarah]”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(Woman in
      Islam. Dr. Gamal A. Badawi. Article published in Islam: Its Meaning and
      Message. pp 138-139. Edited by Professor Dr. Kurshid Ahmed, Chairman of
      the Institute of Policy Studies, Islamabad, Pakistan. The Islamic
      Foundation, U.K.). Dr. Hammudah Abd al Ati pointed out: “This degree may
      be likened to what sociological parlance calls instrumental leadership or
      authority in the household due to role differentiation on the basis of
      sex” (The Family Structure in Islam. p 148).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>The remarks made by Dr. Hasan Turabi, ideologue of the Sudanise
      Islamic movement, are relevant to this issue. He said: “The man is in
      charge of the family, but that amounts only to responsibility for
      financial maintenance or for direction or discipline exercised in a
      reasonable manner. Both spouses should share in the management of family
      affairs, and have equal authority over their sons and daughters” (Women
      in Islam &amp; Muslim Society. p 20. Dr. Hasan Turabi. Milestones
      Publications, London, U.K). “It seems … that the role this particular
      Quranic verse has played in an example of the adaptation of the Quran to
      existing pre-Islamic attitudes. It is high time to go other way and adapt
      male behaviour to the requirements of the Quran” (Islam 2000. p 47.
      Murad Hofmann.). In fact a woman is not her husband’s mere subordinate
      but partner, companion and aide. The problem of the status of woman in
      Islam is not with Islam but with the Islamic thinkers’ understanding of
      Islam which is colored with patriarchal notions. Our religious scholars
      sometimes resort to fanciful, whimsical, far-fetched and distorted
      justifications and interpretations of the divine and sacred law, the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">shariah.</i>
      We must therefore make a clear distinction between the primary sources of
      Islamic law which is Quran and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">sunnah</i>
      and the secondary source which is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">fiqh</i>
      or the jurisprudence. The secondary source reflects views and concepts of
      Muslim thinkers of a particular time and not necessarily of Islam. Views,
      deductions and inferences of the scholars, however eminent, of the earlier
      generation cannot be unequivocally attributed to Islam; these are in fact
      the views and commands of individual Muslim intellectuals and not Islam.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Such views should not be accepted at its face value and need to be
      analyzed and reviewed in the light of the revealed text of the Quran and
      the authentic <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">hadith</i>, the
      primary sources of Islamic law. A review of the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">fiqh </i>does not however in any way diminish their value and sanctity
      but fulfill the requirement of the time.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Another thing which
      deserves attention is that if <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">al-rijal

      Quran 4 (Surat An Nisa): 34-35 quoted above] is interpreted to mean and
      signify that men have a privilege over women because husbands are the
      maintainers of wives, what will happen if a lady, for some reason or
      other, is never married and leads a single life or that she is a divorcee
      or that husband, for financial reason, is incapable to maintain wife and
      also that wife is rich enough to maintain husband. The spirit of Islam is
      not separation between the spouses just because of financial incapacity of
      the husband. Who will lead the family if the husband is seriously ill?<o:p>

      pertinent to discuss verse 2 (Surat Al Baqarah): 228 which is sometimes
      been confused and man is placed higher over woman in respect of status. Al
      Quran states: Divorced women shall wait concerning themselves for three
      monthly periods. And it is not lawful for them to hide what Allah hath
      created in their wombs, if they have faith in Allah and the Last Day. And
      their husbands have the better right to take them back in that period, if
      they wish for reconciliation. And women shall have rights similar to the
      rights against them, according to what is equitable; but men have a degree

      them in kindness, and men are a degree above them … . In their joint
      English rendering Dr. Muhammad Muhsin Khan and Dr. Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din

      their husbands as regards living expenses) similar (to those of their
      husbands) over them (as regards obedience and respect) to what is
      reasonable, but men have a degree (of responsibility) over them … .
      Sayyid Qutub translated the verse: … Women shall, in all fairness, enjoy
      rights similar to those exercised against them, although men have an
      advantage over them … . Muhammad Asad translated the verse: … The
      rights of the wives (with regard to their husbands) are equal to the
      (husbands’) rights with regard to them, although men have precedence
      over them (in this respect) … . Dr. Muhammad Muhsin Khan and Dr.
      Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali in their translation of the verse clearly
      indicated that this higher degree is nothing but the husband’s higher
      degree of responsibility over the wife (Translation of the meanings in
      English of The Noble Quran. p 49. King Fahd Complex For The Printing Of
      The Holy Quran. Saudi Arabia).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Abdullah
      Yusuf Ali indicated that “man’s rights and liabilities a little
      greater than the woman’s” (The Holy Quran: English translation of the

      Presidency of the Islamic Research, IFTA, Call and Guidance. King Fahd

      words men have an advantage over women is that “man who initiates the
      divorce and would therefore have the prerogative to take wife back, a
      decision that could not be left to her to take. This advantage, indeed a
      useful and proper one, is by no means universal, as some have erroneously
      concluded, but is simply dictated by the nature and the circumstances of
      the dispute” (In The Shade Of The Quran. pp 277-279. Vol. 1. Sayyid
      Qutub. English rendering by M. A. Salahi and A. A. Shamis. The Islamic
      Foundation, U.K.). But Muhammad Asad interpreted the verse as: “A
      divorced wife has the right to refuse a resumption of marital relations
      even if the husband expresses, before the expiry of the waiting-period,
      his willingness to have the provisional divorce rescinded; but since it is
      the husband who is responsible for the maintenance of the family, the
      first option to rescind a provisional divorce rests with him” (The
      Message of The Quran. p 50. Note 216.Translated and Explained by Muhammad
      Asad.). Thus it is clear that this verse cannot be taken to mean men’s
      intrinsic and natural superiority over women. Both are human, thus equal.
      The difference between man and woman, if any, is earned and achieved in
      terms of professional excellence and righteousness [Al Quran 49(Sura Al
      Hujurat): 13 and Al Quran 3(Surat Al Imran): 195 and Al Quran 99 (Sura Al
      Zilzal): 7-8].<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Dr. Hammudah Abd al Ati
      pointed out: “The question of the Muslim wife’s obedience and the
      husband’s authority has been viewed from what seems to be a limited
      perspective. It is taken by most writers to be based almost entirely on
      two statements in the Quran and some supplementary Traditions of the
      Prophet <span style="font-size:7.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">(SAWS</span>). The Quran [Al Quran 2(Surat Al Baqarah):228]
      states that women have rights even as they have duties in an equitable
      manner, but men have a degree above women. Again, it states [Al Quran
      4(Surat An Nisa):34] that men are the guardians, protectors, or custodians
      of women because God has made some of them excel others and because men
      expend of their means to maintain women. … Conclusions reached by such
      observers are hardly acceptable at their face value; they should be
      subjected to careful scrutiny and structural analysis. Generalizations
      have been made about the inferiority and subordination of women throughout
      history. Yet the new sociological insights into the nature of the power
      structure within the family may cast some serious doubts on the
      unqualified validity of such generalizations. Men may have believed
      themselves super ordinate or superior and acted according to their own
      definition of the situation. Women also may have behaved at least
      externally, as though they were submissive and subordinate. But whether
      they were actually so in all respects and always is an open question. …
      Moreover, there is a grammatical point that may be suggestive. The verse
      states that men are guardians, etc of women <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">because God has made some of them excel others</i>. The Arabic original
      of the italicized objective pronoun (them) is the plural masculine. If
      taken literally, it would mean that God has made some men excel others.
      But if it is interpreted in conjunction with the first part of the verse,
      where men and women are mentioned, the pronoun <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">them</i>,
      though strictly masculine, can be taken so as to refer to both men and
      women. In this case, excellence is attributed to some generalized men and
      women. This would be based on the grammatical rule of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">taghlib,</i>
      according to which a plural consisting of singulars differentiated on some
      levels may be identified by one of its components and still include the
      rest. For example, the sun and the moon may form a plural which can be
      called the two moons. It would seem that the referents of the objective
      pronoun <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">them</i>, of whom some
      excel, include members of both sexes for at least two reasons. First, if
      excellence is conferred by God on some men to the exclusion of other men
      and also of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">all</i> women (a
      necessary conclusion of taking the original pronoun literally as a plural
      masculine), it would be difficult to explain why the Quran clearly
      designates men in general as guardians of women, or why it allocates right
      and duties to the male sex on the merit of only <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">some</i>
      members thereof. Secondly, the object of the verb excel is defined neither
      by the masculine nor by the feminine pronoun, nor is the content of
      excellence specified in the verse. There is no direct indication of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">who
      </i>is excelled or in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">what</i>
      excellence is. Furthermore, it is a grammatical rule that the pronoun
      refers to the nearest preceding noun unless otherwise indicated. The
      nearest referent of the pronoun <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">them</i>
      in the verse is actually women, not men. If the interpreters of the Quran
      adhered to this rule of Arabic grammar, they would have concluded that God
      has made some of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">them</i>, i.e.
      women, excel. But they, instead took the verse to mean that God has made
      some men excel. They went further to specify or define those who are
      excelled as women, and further still to conclude that men as such, not
      only some of them, excel and hence are superior to women as such, not only
      some of them.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Such an interpretation and conclusion seem to draw no
      substantiation from the verse. They must have been reflections of the
      prevailing social conditions and mental dispositions. Not originating in
      any textual authentic declarations, they must have been adopted by men who
      actually believed themselves superior to women, in an age when external
      appearances probably lent support to such a belief and in places where
      instrumental authority overcast expressive authority.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The verse, which is some what equivocal, was adduced perhaps to
      rationalize those contemporary conditions and to give those men at least
      the appearance of evidence in support of their views, so that they would
      not be taken as contrary to the principles of religion.”<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">“In view of this
      analysis, a reinterpretation of the verse may be worth attempting. Men are
      guardians, etc of women because men and women are not completely alike;
      they are differentiated and differentiable in various respects. Some of
      them, men and women, are endowed with what others, men and women, lack”
      (The Family Structure in Islam. pp 173, 175,179-180 Dr. Hammudah Abd al
      Ati).<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Another issue which needs
      to be clarified is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">hijab,</i>
      headgear or the covering of the head by the women which is sometimes
      confused with covering of the face by the believing women. In verse 33 (Sura
      Al Ahzab): 59 believing Muslim women have been advised that they should
      cast their outer garments (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">min
      jalabibihinna</i>) over their persons when out of doors. Al Quran states:
      O Prophet! Tell your wives and daughters and the believing women that they
      should cast their outer garments over their persons (when out of doors):
      That is most convenient, that they should be known (as such) and not
      molested and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful [Al Quran 33 (Sura Al
      Ahzab):59] This general instruction should not however be confused with
      specific instruction for the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">ummul
      muminin</i>, the mothers of the believers contained in the verse 33 (Sura
      Al Ahzab): 53 wherein Muslim males were advised to talk to the wives of
      the Prophet Muhammad (saws) from behind a screen. Al Quran states: O you
      who believe! Enter not the Prophet’s house until leave is given you for
      a meal (and then) not (so early as) to wait for its preparation: but when
      you are invited, enter; and when you have taken your meal, disperse
      without seeking familiar talk. Such (behaviour) annoys the Prophet he is
      shy to dismiss you, but Allah is not shy (to tell you) the truth. And when
      you ask (his ladies) for anything you want, ask them from before a screen:
      that makes for greater purity for your hearts and for theirs. …<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>[Al Quran 33 (Sura Al Ahzab): 53].<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span>Now let us read the general instruction towards the believing
      women as mentioned in the verse quoted above [Al Quran 33 (Sura Al Ahzab):
      59] together with verse 24 (Sura An Nur): 30- 31 which tells women not to
      display their beauty and adornment except that which is apparent. The
      general instruction of Islam is that man should lower his look when his
      eyes fall on the face of a woman and vice versa. Al Quran states: Say to
      the believing men that they should lower their gaze … And say to the
      believing women that they should lower their gaze and guard<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>their<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>modesty<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>[others have translated as: guard their sexual organs, protect
      their private parts. mindful of their chastity]; that they should not
      display their beauty and ornaments except what (ordinarily) appear their
      of (Arabic word used is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">illa ma
      zahara minha</i>), that they should draw their veils over their bosoms and
      not display their beauty … [Al Quran 24 (Sura An Nur): 30-31].<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Traditionally <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">illa
      ma zahara minha</i> has been interpreted allowing only women’s face,
      hands and feet to be uncovered. This is the view of Imam Abu Hanifa. Imam
      Malik and Imam Shafi hold the same view. Imam Abu Yusuf of Hanafi School
      of Thought is however of the view that women, within the limits of<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">
      illa ma zahara minha</i>, can also keep their hands uncovered up to elbow
      (Hedaya. Babul Qarahiya). But others oppose the view saying that face of
      the woman attracts man most and therefore face should be totally covered.
      But this view is not tenable. The instruction of the verse quoted above is
      that both men and women are required to keep their eye cast down, so that
      when<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>they meet each other,
      neither should men stare at women nor women at men. The natural question
      that arises is why man should lower his gaze if the face of woman is
      totally covered? From the text of the verse it is clearly evident that the
      face of the woman is not to be covered and therefore man has been advised
      to lower his look.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Eminent Islamic scholar
      Dr. Yusuf Al Qaradawi however pointed out: A difference is to be noted
      here between the expressions, “lower their gaze” and “guard their
      sexual organs”, signifying that while the sexual organs must be totally
      guarded without any leeway, the lowering of the gaze is only partial,
      because necessity and the general interest of the people require that some
      looking at the members of the opposite sex is allowed. “Lowering the
      gazes” does not mean that in the presence of the opposite sex the eyes
      should be shut or that head should be bowed toward the ground, since this
      would be impossible…. Here “lowering of the gazes” means to avert
      one’s gaze from the faces of the passers-by and not to caress the
      attractive features of the members of the opposite sex with one’s eyes
      (The Lawful and the Prohibited in Islam. pp 152-153. Dr.Yusuf Al Qaradawi.
      American Trust Publications. Indinapolis, USA.). Dr. Qaradawi pointed out
      that what is not allowed is lustful look (ibid p 153).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The Prophet (saws) taught Muslims, if they had to sit by the road,
      to lower their gaze as women pass by, Dr. Hasan Turabi wrote quoting
      Muslim (Women in Islam &amp; Muslim Society. p 23). A man should not gaze
      at a woman or a woman at a man so fixedly that temptation is stimulated.
      Instead, whenever any such thing strikes the mind, one must desist from
      looking on. The Prophet (saws) advised Ali (r): “O Ali, you must not
      gaze at a woman. You are allowed the first look but not the subsequent”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Dr. Hasan Turabi however pointed out: “Ali’s report does not
      mean that looking at a person of the opposite sex is absolutely forbidden.
      It is only when one seeks sexual pleasure or finds and relishes it.
      Indeed, in the model society of Islam, Muslims used to assemble freely and
      frequently; they were mostly acquainted with each other, men and women;
      they conversed and interacted intensively. But all those activities were
      undertaken in a spirit of innocence and in the context of a virtuous
      society (ibid. pp 29-30).<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Varying on the condition
      of the climate, heat, wind and dust, women however do cover their face in
      different regions. Eminent thinker and intellectual and former German
      diplomat Murad Wilfried Hofmann pointed out that veiling women totally is
      “a custom that is not Arab but Byzantine and Iranian in origin. Women of
      leisure and high social standing had obviously found out that they could
      underline their class by taking to the veil. Making them seem slightly
      remote, this device would make them appear more rare and precious. And of
      course, cultivating the veil simultaneously enhanced the Oriental
      proclivity for jealously. At any rate, it is a fact that at the time of
      Prophet and immediately afterwards, Muslim women were not totally veiled
      (and Bedouin women in Saudi Arabia are still not). Indeed, women pilgrims
      to Makkah must not be veiled because their predecessors, contemporaries of
      the Prophet, were not when they went out on pilgrimage”&nbsp;<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">“On the one hand, it is
      not without logic that Saudi women go voluntarily beyond the Quranic
      obligation to cover themselves. If the purpose of covering a woman’s
      hair, bosom and arms is to save her from becoming a sex object, to protect
      marriages from unabashed solicitation, and to avoid a vain and ruinous
      beauty fashion competition among women, then why should such strong points
      of sexual fixation as eyes, mouth and ankles remain on public display?”
      (Journey to Islam. pp 78-79. Murad Wilfried Hofmann. The Islamic
      Foundation, U.K.).</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Nonetheless it should be
      kept in mind that a person is identified by the face. Modern psychologists
      and public relations experts study face to ascertain the character and
      mental makeup of the individual. Face is the reflection of personality.
      Forcing women to totally veil or cover their face in fact tantamount to
      destruction of the personality of the women. A woman however has the
      inalienable fundamental rights to live in a society which allows her to
      blossom. Woman like man can however expose her personality not through
      nakedness but through decent adornment and covering of the body. Al Quran
      states: O you children of Adam! We have bestowed raiment upon you to cover
      your shame as well as to be an adornment to you, but the raiment of
      righteousness- that is best.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Such
      are among the Signs of Allah that they may receive admonition! O you
      children of Adam! Let not Satan seduce you in the same manner as he got
      your parents out of the Garden, stripping them of their raiment, to expose
      their shame: for he and his tribe see you from a position where you cannot
      see them: We made the Satans friends (only) to those without faith” [Al
      Quran 7 (Surat Al Araf): 26-27]. <o:p>
