      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">In a seminar held 
      recently &nbsp;in Dhaka on ‘DNA &amp; RNA in the Holy Quran’ some Islamic scholars 
      argued that it is not proper to try to relate the verses of the Quran with 
      science and try to determine its meaning in that perspective. They argued 
      that science is an ever changing phenomenon and the assumption and 
      prediction of the scientist may be wrong whereas the teachings of Islam 
      are eternal and not subject to human error. The purpose of such research, 
      they argued, is to validate Quran or establish the truth of the Quran by 
      such scientific investigation which is wrong. But if we look at the Quran 
      we find that in Islam such research is not forbidden rather the Quran has 
      asked Muslims again and again to refer to the nature to investigate [2 (Surat 
      Al Baqarah):164, 3 (Surat Al Imran):190-191, 6 (Surat Al Anam): 97, 6 (Surat 
      Al Anam): 99, 7 (Surat Al Araf): 54, 10 (Surat Yunus): 5-6, 12 (Surat 
      Yusuf):105, 13 (Surat Al Rad): 2-4, 16 (Surat An Nahl): 8, 16 (Surat An 
      Nahl):12,&nbsp; 21(Surat Al Anbiyaa):16, 21(Surat Al Anbiyaa):30, 22(Surat Al 
      Hajj): 47, 24(Surat An Nur): 35, 29(Surat An Ankabut): 20, 29(Surat An 
      Ankabut): 44, 30 (Surat Ar Rum):8, 30(Surat Ar Rum): 22, 31(Surat Luqman): 
      10, 31(Surat Luqman):20, 31(Surat Luqman): 29, 35 (Surat Fatir): 13, &nbsp;36 (Surat 
      Yasin): 36-38, 36 (Surat Yasin): 40-42, 38 (Surat Sad):27, 39 (Surat Az 
      Zumar): 5, 41(Surat Ha Mim): 9, 41(Surat Ha Mim): 11, 41(Surat Ha Mim): 
      54, 43 (Surat Zukhruf): 12, 44(Surat Ad Dukhan): 38, 45(Surat Al Jathiya): 
      4-5, 45 (Surat Al Jathiya): 13, 46(Surat Al Ahqaf):3, 51(Surat Az Zariyat): 
      7, 51(Surat Az Zariyat): 49, 55 (Surat Ar Rahman): 3-5,&nbsp; 55 (Surat Ar 
      Rahman): 33, 56 (Surat Al Waqia): 68-69, 65 (Surat At Talaq):12,&nbsp; 67 (Surat 
      Al Mulk): 3, 70 (Surat Al Maarij): 4, 71(Surat Nuh): 14-17, 81(Surat At 
      Takwir): 16, 96 (Surat Al Alaq):1-2].&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Another participant in 
      the seminar pointed out that we must have absolute faith in the truth of 
      the Quran and our finite mind is not competent to undertake such studies. 
      But having absolute faith in the teachings of Islam does not in anyway 
      prohibit us from undertaking such research. In this connection we can 
      refer to the verses of the Quran in which Prophet Ibrahim, peace be upon 
      him, said to Allah: “My Lord! Show me how You give life to the dead”. In 
      response Allah asked Prophet Ibrahim: “Do you not then believe”. Prophet 
      Ibrahim replied: “Yes! But for the satisfaction of my own heart”. This 
      dialogue between Allah swt and Prophet Ibrahim is mentioned in verse 2 (Surat 
      Al Baqarah): 260 of the Holy Quran. Muslims should therefore continue such 
      research for the satisfaction of the heart.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Moreover Quran is the 
      Last Book of Allah and valid for all times to come and its meanings will 
      unfold as the time passes. What we can now interpret, our previous 
      generation could not- for knowledge including science and technology at 
      that period has not developed to the current stage. Further there is no 
      reason to think that we cannot contribute over what our earlier 
      generations have done. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">In Islam Taqlid or blind 
      imitation whether of the past or the present day research, is not 
      permitted [2 (Surat Al Baqarah):170. 5 (Surat Al Maida):104, 7(Surat Al 
      Araf): 28, 21(Surat Al Anbiyya):53-54, 31(Surat Luqman): 21] and the door 
      of Ijtihad- research and investigation is not closed either. The history 
      of the Ijtihad goes back to the time of Prophet Muhammad, peace and 
      blessings be upon him, when he authorized Muadh b. Jabal as Governor of 
      Yemen to exercise his individual judgment if a clear instruction is not 
      available in the Quran or in the Sunnah. Prophet even authorized Amar b. 
      al-As to adjudicate in some disputes when Prophet was present [Mohammad 
      Hashim Kamali. Principles of Islamic Jurisprudence p 383. Islamic Texts 
      Society, Cambridge. 1991]. From this scholars and analysts concluded that 
      Ijtihad is allowed in Islam and Ijtihad is the Sunnah of the Prophet 
      Muhammad. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">If the Mufassirs or the 
      commentators of the Quran of the non-Arab world, having no absolute 
      command over Arabic and lexicography compared to first-second-third 
      generation Imams or Islamic scholars, could make Tafsir or the commentary 
      of the Quran and even the non-Muslims have translated the Quran, how than 
      we can object such scientific research vis a vis the Quran by people who 
      do not know much Arabic and depend on the known and widely accepted 
      translation of the Quran. We all know that if we have good intention we 
      will be rewarded by Allah swt even if we are mistaken in our Ijtihad. 
      Prophet Muhammad said: Whoever makes a reasoned decision (Ijtihad) and is 
      correct will receive two rewards, while he who does so and is incorrect 
      will receive one reward [Bukhari and Abu Dawud. Quoted in To be a European 
      Muslim by Tariq Ramadan. p28. Islamic Foundation, Leicester, U.K].</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">One example will make the 
      point clear. All earlier Mufassirs or the commentators of the Quran 
      translated verse 13 [Surat Ar Rad]:11 as Allah will not change the 
      condition of a people unless they change their <i>condition</i>. But later 
      the Arab and other scholars made the correct and more appropriate 
      translation of this verse- that Allah will not change the condition of a 
      people <i>unless they change what is in themselves</i> (unfusehum). When 
      we do not find anything wrong or we do not object such translation by 
      Islamic scholars having no absolute command over Arabic and lexicography, 
      how we then can oppose when same category of people who have no absolute 
      command over Arabic language and lexicography doing scientific research 
      vis a vis the Quran. We therefore cannot deny our scholars and scientists 
      the right to make scientific investigation vis a vis the Quran</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">It should however be 
      understood that Quran is basically a book of guidance and not of say 
      chemistry, physics, biology etc. etc. So the findings of such scientific 
      research and investigation may prove wrong but the Quran is right. There 
      is no question of validating Quran or establish the truth of the Quran by 
      our scientific investigation as some scholars argue <i>rather it is the 
      oppo</i>site. The Muslim scientists and investigators become astonished to 
      see the similarity between the statement of the Quran and those made by 
      the Prophet some fourteen hundred years ago when science was not at the 
      stage as it is now and therefore Muslim, even some non-Muslim scientists 
      affirm that Quran is the Book of Allah- SubhanAllah, praise be to Allah.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Some scholars argue that 
      such study should be conducted under supervision of those who are expert 
      on methodological study of Islam and that such research, scientific study 
      and investigation be conducted under the scholarly guidance of those who 
      are expert of Arabic language and lexicography; I do not entirely reject 
      the idea. But then again even the methodology has been developed by human 
      beings like us and not Prophet Muhammad. Even those who are expert in 
      Arabic and methodical study are not in a position to give their views on 
      scientific matters as they don’t have the elementary knowledge of science. 
      It is important that we all learn Arabic so that we can understand the 
      meanings of the Quran direct and we do not have to depend on the 
      translation. It is equally important that we study the rules of 
      interpretation- Usul al Fiqh for that will strengthen us in undertaking 
      our study and research, scientific or otherwise.</p>

      continue such scientific studies vis a vis the Quran may consult available
