      <p align="justify">How is US becoming richer day by day at the expense of 
      the Third World counties? How the American Empire expanding its claw over 
      the poor under developed countries and plundering their wealth and 
      resources? US is imposing its interest on others ignoring their legitimate 
      rights in the name of globalization. It is destroying, in the name of free 
      trade, the economy of other nations and their potentials. The policy 
      planners in the White House and Pentagon see the interest of America as 
      the interest of the world. Today the world has become an extended American 
      village. <br>
      <br>
      The current US aggression and occupation of Iraq for possessing weapons of 
      mass destruction has proved to be a deliberate lie. Toppling Saddam 
      Hussain also was not the real agenda. Ostensibly US intervenes in the 
      Third World countries in the name of defending democracy, human rights and 
      freedom, but beneath the apparent reason, the real intention always is 
      protecting markets and plunder wealth and resources of the country it is 
      invading. Henry Kissinger, former US Secretary of State, in 2001 stated 
      that “oil is too important a commodity to be left in the hands of the 
      Arabs” (Feryal Ali Gauhar, US Expansionist Design in the Middle East. The 
      New Nation, 3 January 2004).The fear of the analysts has now proved true 
      that US in collusion with its allies invaded Iraq to steal Iraqi oil and 
      she is successfully doing this by giving contracts only to US 
      multinational corporations. Pentagon on 5 December 2003 barred French, 
      German, Russian and Canadian companies from $ 18.6 billion contracts for 
      the reconstruction of Iraq for not joining US war against Iraq which 
      recently UN Secretary General Kofi Annan has declared illegal (AFP, 
      Washington. 10 December 2003).<br>
      <br>
      Counterpunch magazine, immediately after 9/11, published a report by 
      American peace activist Zoltan Grossman based on Congressional Records and 
      the Library of Congress Research Service. According to this report US 
      military made 134 interventions, small or big, global or domestic, 
      covering 111 years between 1890 and 2001 including intervention in 
      Afghanistan, that means on an average 1.15 interventions per year up to 
      the end of World War II; that increased to 1.29 during Cold War, and after 
      the fall of Berlin Wall increased further to 2.0 per year. No doubt the 
      hyper-imperialist US increased the number of interventions to protect its 
      interest in the expanding world the pattern of which changed drastically 
      since the end of Cold War. The first focus of US intervention was East 
      Asia- Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia and Iran. This was extremely violent. The 
      second intervention was Eastern Europe but due to the presence of now 
      defunct USSR as counter balancing force the attacks were not that violent. 
      The third phase was Latin America starting from Cuba and spreading rest of 
      the countries of the region. The forth phase is focused on West Asia, the 
      Middle East- starting from Palestine, Iran, Libya, Lebanon-Syria and moved 
      on to Iraq during in 1990s and the beginning of 21st century to 
      Afghanistan. US interventions started, civilization wise, from 
      Confucian-Buddhist to Orthodox Christian, then to Catholic Christian, and 
      finally to Islamic civilization.<br>
      <br>
      This US did with or without the help of UN. US behaves as if UN is her 
      sole property, former UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali commented 
      in his book ‘Unvanquished: a US-UN Saga’. US through intimidation, threat 
      and use of veto manipulated the world body for the benefit of its own 
      interest (Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Unvanquished: a US-UN Saga, New York, 
      Random House, 1999). When it suits US, it uses UN to seek the legitimacy 
      for its actions, to build coalitions and impose sanction on what it calls 
      the rogue states as happened during 1990s. When the world opinion goes 
      against the US, it treats UN with utter contempt as during the current 
      Iraqi invasion and occupation. Prior to the current Iraqi invasion, US 
      forcibly took away the dossier Iraq submitted to UN denying that it posses 
      WMD without the knowledge and approval of the UN Secretary General or 
      Security Council or General Assembly. US always tries to use UN as its 
      rubber stamp. Throughout UN history US has consistently vetoed all UN 
      resolutions and declarations that did not reflect US priorities and 
      business interest. US despise for the world opinion is reflected when 
      Boutros Boutros-Ghali was elected to the top post of UN in 1992, US vetoed 
      an extension of his term to 2001 despite approval of many other member 
      states of the world organization. <br>
      <br>
      US maintains total control over World Trade Organization. WTO is indeed a 
      major instrument for maintaining American neo-imperialism. WTO is not the 
      only instrument for maintaining US hyper-power and technological 
      hyper-imperialism but also include International Monetary Fund and the 
      World Bank. WTO, IMF and World Bank are the most ambiguous and 
      undemocratic global institutions. The secrecy surrounding their decision 
      making process makes them ideal bodies for keeping the rest of the world 
      firmly at their grasp. WTO and IMF have effective mechanism for 
      enforcement of obligation, particularly over the developing countries, WTO 
      through the threat of retaliation against export of goods, IMF through 
      loan conditions which are imposed mercilessly. US uses these mechanisms to 
      keep the developing countries in line, and ensure the progress of 
      multinational companies by removing the impediment. To strengthen its 
      grip, US manipulates to make sure that the top jobs of WTO, IMF and World 
      Bank are shared by the West, US and Europe. <br>
      <br>
      The world economy largely functions for the benefit of US and US led G7, 
      now G8 countries that operate to keep the developing nations poor. 
      Developing countries are forced to import expensive and often outdated 
      technology from US and other industrialized countries. The Third World 
      countries seldom can maintain and manage expensive technology. Very often 
      such technology undercut local technical know-how and age-old 
      manufacturing potentials and end up marginalizing the poor even more. The 
      misfortunes of the poor are thus a direct by-product of the self interest 
      of the rich. <br>
      <br>
      US accumulated the wealth of the world through various kinds of 
      manipulations. It finances domestic growth through savings of the rest of 
      the world. Being the currency leader, US benefits from free money, of 
      issuing dollars for the use as cash around the world. <br>
      <br>
      US refuses the countries of the Third World control over their own 
      economics. Most of the countries have no role on matters decided at IMF 
      headquarters and no say in its policy issues and little power to bring 
      about affective change in WTO. The policies attached with IMF loans, which 
      behind the scene US manipulates and dictates, lead the way to foreign 
      ownership and domination of the economy of the loan receiving poor 
      underdeveloped Third World countries, especially of the manufacturing and 
      financial sectors. For example, after the South-East Asian economic 
      crisis, IMF, at the insistence of the US, imposed on Thailand and South 
      Korea the condition that they must allow higher foreign ownership of their 
      economics. As part of the deal with IMF, Thailand was asked to allow 
      foreign banks to own more equity in the local banking sector. Through such 
      loan conditions, US business and technology corporations ended up wholly 
      or partially owning banks, financial institutions and key technology 
      sectors in the developing world. <br>
      During the 1997 economic crisis, the value of the Malaysian Ringgit was 
      reduced by 40 per cent, the Thai Bath by 55 per cent and the Indonesian 
      Rupee by 80 per cent as a result of which the purchasing power of the 
      region decreased by 700-800 billion dollars. The per capita income reduced 
      to half in terms of dollar. The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange, then the 
      biggest share market institution in East Asia, was worst affected. On 5 
      January 1997, the Price Index of the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange stood at 
      1,332.04, within one year, on 12 January 1998, it slide down and the Price 
      Index reduced to 419.60 as a result lost value by 63 per cent within only 
      one year. Because of the crisis and the negative role of IMF, East Asian 
      countries lost trillion dollars. But few could identify the real 
      manipulator behind the scene. <br>
      <br>
      In fact the West, particularly US – the lone superpower of the world, 
      played pivotal role in the making of this economic crisis. The West became 
      worried at the growth rate of the Asian countries because they thought 
      that these countries appearing in the scene as major actor to control 
      global economy and considered it as a threat to the interest of the West 
      in the region. The policy planners of US thought that East Asia is not 
      only becoming the center of global economic power but also poses a threat 
      to US interest. This was rightly pointed out by the Chinese newspaper 
      Peoples Daily. In an editorial in 1998 Peoples Daily commented that IMF 
      used East Asian crisis to protect and advance its strategic interest, and 
      US and IMF interests are intertwined. The West destroyed the economy of 
      the emerging Asian countries by manipulating share market and IMF is the 
      chief instrument and weapon in its armory. <br>
      <br>
      US is manipulating trade liberalization, the removal or reduction of 
      barriers to international trade in goods and services, for one way open 
      access of American goods and thereby secure the interest of the 
      multinationals. Under WTO’s Agreement on Agriculture, and World Bank–IMF 
      imposed Structural Adjustment Program, at the behest of US, developing 
      countries made significant changes in their food and agricultural policies 
      and opened their economies to low-priced food imports while withdrawing 
      and reducing subsidy to their farmers. Under this arrangement WTO members 
      had to reduce tariff on food imports, state-run enterprises were 
      privatized, eliminating subsidies and price controls and closure of state 
      run marketing institutions. In fact, the whole arrangement is tied up by 
      US and EU which enabled them to export their surplus goods economically to 
      the developing countries, dump their goods sold below the cost of 
      production, in which the farmers, unable to compete, closed production 
      because farmers are sometimes forced to pay heavily for inputs often even 
      for seeds. Thus local agriculture is destroyed, domestic food production 
      is shattered, and food security of the country is seriously compromised 
      and endangered. <br>
      <br>
      The ‘economic freedom’, promoted by US, in reality destroys the economic 
      freedom of the poor. In the name of free market economy it has, on the one 
      hand, opened for US technology-driven business the opportunity to enter 
      freely and capture the markets of the Third World countries. It has, on 
      the other hand, hindered the efforts of the developing countries to boost 
      their own products and exports, and bars them for US markets. Thus the 
      so-called free trade promoted by WTO and IMF amounts to highway robbery, 
      benefiting only the rich at the expanse of the poor, while making the poor 
      more vulnerable to food insecurity. As a consequence of American policies, 
      in a single day under globalization, poor countries lose nearly $ 2 
      billion due to rigged international trade and $ 60 million drains from 
      poor to rich countries in debt. <br>
      <br>
      US always undercut the efforts of the least developed countries to combat 
      poverty. It imposes huge tariff on primary agricultural produces such as 
      food stuff. These trade restrictions cost the poorer countries of the 
      world a staggering $ 2.5 billion a year in lost foreign exchange earnings 
      [according to the statistics of 2002]. The overall effects are disastrous. 
      The dumping of American products in such labor intensive and job-creating 
      areas as agriculture, often at price lower than cost of production, has 
      shattered the economy of the importing Third World countries and reduced 
      the vulnerable population of such countries to abject poverty. <br>
      <br>
      US gains from contracts with poor under developed and developing counties 
      are real and tangible, whereas the benefits derived by the Third World 
      countries from such contracts are illusory. Unequal contracts are largely 
      responsible for the increase of abject poverty in Africa, Latin America 
      and Asian countries. For example, US offers duty and quota free access for 
      African textiles and clothing to the American market provided these 
      products only use US fabrics and yarns. US imposes severe restrictions on 
      textiles made of African materials. The requirement of US raw materials to 
      be used in African products not only undermines the African countries’ own 
      domestic raw materials industries, but makes African textile products 
      uncompetitive in US market because importing US raw materials for textile 
      production in Africa is expensive given the transportation and other costs 
      involved, on the one hand. US, on the other hand, demands elimination of 
      barriers to all US trade and investment in Africa and equal treatment of 
      US and African firms. <br>
      <br>
      US always works to bring the commodity prices down in developing world. 
      This it does to derive benefits as the principal consumer. Because of 
      deflation, US citizens benefit from price stability and the shock of wave 
      is felt in producer countries. The major contributor to low inflation has 
      been the consistent decline in prices for commodities, exported by 
      indebted countries, encouraged to get into exports as the way out of debt 
      by WTO and IMF.<br>
      <br>
      Besides US imposes economic sanction as and when required if these 
      manipulations are not sufficient. US sanction against Iraq for more than a 
      decade which has been withdrawn only recently after its occupation is 
      still vivid in the peoples’ memory. During the last 80 years, such 
      sanctions have been imposed on various countries on 120 occasions, 104 of 
      them since World War II. In 1998 alone, US imposed sanctions against 75 
      countries, amounting 52 percent of the world’s population. Beneficiaries 
      of all these manipulations and exploitations of the global economy are US 
      consumers. <br>
      <br>
      US is not satisfied by overt and covert manipulation of the poor 
      underdeveloped and developing economy of the Third World counties. It 
      wants to make sure that its citizens in no way become victim anywhere 
      outside America because of wrong doing. We therefore see that WB, at the 
      behest of US, is putting pressure on Bangladesh to pass such legislation 
      in the parliament that will give immunity to World Bank officials so that 
      the officials of WB cannot be challenged in the Bangladesh court for their 
      wrong doing. This is because WB is mainly manned by nationals of US, 
      Europe and other Western countries. During the presidency of Bill Clinton 
      the name of the Thai national Supachai Panitchpakdi came up for the top 
      job of WTO, but President Clinton threatened a permanent stalemate at WTO 
      unless America’s chosen candidate is accepted. The other reason for which 
      WB wants immunity for its officials is that sometimes officials of the 
      international agencies such as WB work for CIA and other Western 
      intelligence agencies and use their official position as cover and they 
      want to make it sure that they cannot be touched even after such nefarious 
      activities. Bangladesh on 17 August 2003 signed an agreement with Unites 
      States under which no American soldiers and officers charged with criminal 
      offence can be tried in Bangladesh or sent to International Criminal Court 
      for prosecution. According to a UNB report Bangladesh Ambassador to 
      Washington Syed Hassan Ahmed and US Assistant Secretary of State Christian 
      Rocca initiated the agreement in US capital on behalf of the respective 
      governments (The New Nation. 5 September 2003). Earlier after 9/11 US 
      passed legislation to the effect that it troops cannot be tried for 
      genocide and crime against humanity and it rescinded the protocol of 
      International Criminal Court signed previously. Behind all US actions, the 
      principal objective is to secure the national interest of America even if 
      such interest goes against the interest of others. This is Pax America. 
      This is the New World Order, if we at all call it an order, for how can a 
      system based on injustice, self interest, devoid of ethics and morality be 
      described as an order. This is the vision of the American Empire of the 
      new conservatives- the new cons.</td>
