      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Can Israel protect itself 
      from the popular Palestinian uprising and reprisal by using brutal force, 
      military power, Western protection and Gobbles propaganda, this question 
      is often been raised by the geo-political strategists and commentators. 
      Several factors are not in Israel’s favor. The most important factor is 
      demographic. The birth rate of the Palestinian Muslims is much more than 
      the Jews settled in Israel and within next 50 years the Muslim population 
      will out number the Jews in the state of Israel [Ibrahim M. Abu Rabi, <i>
      Globalization: A Contemporary Islamic Response</i>, The American Journal 
      of Islamic Social Sciences, No.3, Vol. 15, 1998, IIIT, USA. p 35. Also Lee 
      Hockstader in The Washington Post, Sunday 16 August 1998, quoted in Impact 
      International UK. Vol. 28. No.12. December 1998]. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">It appears, too, that 
      Israeli leaders have begun to fathom the demographic time-bomb – the 
      looming specter of an Arab majority that would jeopardize the Jewish 
      character of Israel. Indeed, some analysts in Israel believe that this was 
      one of the main factors behind Sharon’s disengagement plan. According to 
      Al Ahram Weekly Gaza’s 1,700,000 Palestine population is expected to 
      increase by 3.9 per cent annually [Samir Ghattas, <i>Post-withdrawal 
      Scenario</i>, Al Ahram Weekly, Egypt, quoted in The New Nation, 19 June 
      2004].</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">In a speech delivered to 
      the students of Israeli Academy of War and broadcast by public radio 
      Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon warned that Israel needs to withdraw 
      from Gaza Strip to maintain the “Jewish and democratic character” of the 
      state, AFP from Jerusalem reported on 17 July 2004. “We will not be able 
      to preserve the Jewish and democratic character of the state if we 
      continue to rule over one million Palestinians” in the Gaza Strip, Sharon 
      told. The argument is the strongest put forward yet by the hawkish 
      right-wing prime minister for his plan to evacuate troops and Jewish 
      settlers from the Gaza Strip by the end of 2005. “We can’t ignore Israel’s 
      demographic concern”, Sharon said in a reference to the Palestinian higher 
      birth rate. According to official projections, by 2010 Israel’s 5.2 
      million strong Jewish population will be overtaken by that of the West 
      Bank and Gaza, together home to more than three million Palestinians, and 
      the Jewish state’s own Arab citizens [<i>Israel Must Withdraw from Gaza: 
      Sharon</i>, The New Nation, 18 July 2004].&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">According to Al Ahram 
      Weekly columnist Ibrahim Nafie, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon is 
      opposed to the idea of&nbsp; Palestinian refugees return to their homeland 
      “since the return of the Palestinian refugees is a threat to the Jewish 
      character of the state” [Ibrahim Nafie, <i>Bush Mubarak Meet</i>,

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">AP from Jerusalem on 5 
      December 2003 quoting Israel’s Vice Premier Ehud Olmert reported that 
      Israel will have to unilaterally define its boarders, dismantle some 
      settlements and withdraw from most of the West Bank, Gaza Strip and some 
      parts of east Jerusalem. Israel is a rapidly approaching the point where 
      Arabs will outnumber Jews in areas under Israeli control. Palestinians 
      might then demand the right to vote, Olmet said, adding that “the day they 
      get it, we will lose everything”, reported Yediot Ahronot newspaper [<i>Israel 
      Rules Out Any Deal with Palestinians</i>, The New Nation, 6 December 
      2003].</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Israeli Finance Minister 
      Benjamin Netanyahu addressing a conference on security issues held in 
      Herzliya, north of Tel Aviv on 17 December 2003 claimed that the Israeli 
      Arab population posed a demographic threat to the Israel. Netanyahu 
      claimed that if the percentage of Arab citizens rises above its current 
      level of about 20 percent “than the Jewish state will be annulled” [Yasser 
      El Bana, IOL Gaza Correspondent, <i>Netanyahu’s Racist Remarks Under Fire</i>,

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Neil R. Huff, Boulder 
      City, USA writing in the New Nation on 22 April 2004 commented that “key 
      to the Israel’s destruction lies within, not without”. The Israeli Arabs 
      are the key to ending Israel as a pure Jewish state. A high sustained 
      fertility rate and Islamic polygamy will raise the current number of 
      Israeli Arabs (estimated at 20 percent) to a potent political force within 
      15 to 20 years [<i>Palestinians will be next for ethnic cleansing</i>, The 
      New Nation, 22 April 2002]. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Henry Kissinger, former 
      US Secretary of State, in an article pointed out that Biblical claim of 
      Israel “may lead to a demographic time bomb in which Arabs become a 
      majority in Palestine and demand control of the entire land … Israeli 
      public opinion has to come to accept that the only means to prevent a 
      demographic disaster is a Palestinian state’ [Henry Kissinger, <i>A Thorny 
      Road to Peace</i>, Tribune Media Services International, quoted in The New 
      Nation, 30 January 2004, p8].&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Dr. Edward Tivnan, 
      eminent journalist—contributor to The New York Times magazine, writer for 
      Time and ABC News, pointed out that “demographic problem … already a major 
      concern among the Israeli doves: if Israel annexed the territories … then 
      the Arabs, as Israeli citizens, could vote to transfer Israel into a 
      bi-national secular state; if those Arabs were not allowed to be citizens, 
      Israel could no longer be considered much of a democracy [Edward Tivnan,
      <i>The Lobby: Jewish Political Power &amp; American Foreign Policy</i>, Simon 
      &amp; Schuster, Inc.1230 Avenue of the Americas, New York, 1987, p 110].</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Although Israel initially 
      attracted diverse population from many corners of the world, i.e. from 
      Arab world, Eastern Europe, former Soviet Union and Ethiopia, the majority 
      of the Jews from West Europe and North America have so far shown no real 
      intention of migrating to and living in Israel. Jews are reluctant to come 
      to settle in Israel any more. The Russian Jews now prefer to settle in USA 
      for a better living than settle in their dreamland Israel. This is because 
      they no more feel secure in Israel. Israelis are now holding duel 
      nationality. According to statistics provided by the Liberty for the 
      Muslim World UK, an organization working for the protection of human 
      rights and democratization, a million Jews have duel Israel-American 
      citizenship and a huge number of South African Jews hold two passports and 
      they are ready to leave Israel any moment as they feel insecure in <u>
      violent</u> ridden Zionist state. Constant conflict has destroyed their 
      peace of mind and most of the Jews now consider Israel as the ‘most 
      dangerous place in the world for a Jew’. This has now become manifest from 
      their behavior. Since 2000 some 300,000 Jews have left Israel for America 
      and Europe because of the insecurity spawned by the Palestinian intifada 
      [Mustafa Malik, <i>A Crusader State Again</i>, The New Nation, 7 February 
      2004]. In 1980-1981 … for the first time in the history of Jewish state, 
      the number of Israelis leaving the country- called <i>yordim</i>, those 
      who descend- outstripped the number of immigrants [Edward Tivnan, <i>The 
      Lobby: Jewish Political Power &amp; American Foreign Policy</i>,. Simon &amp; 
      Schuster, Inc.1230 Avenue of the Americas, New York. 1987, p 225]. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Richard H. Curtiss drew 
      particular attention to the fact that “half of each generation of American 
      Jews end up marrying non-Jews, Arab Americans, on the other hand, whether 
      Muslim or Christian, are increasing’ [Richard H. Curtiss, <i>
      Demonstrations Test American Support</i>, Arab News, Saudi Arabia, quoted 
      in The New Nation, 27 April 2004]. This would, no doubt, further 
      complicate the scenario of the demographic problem of the Israel for their 
      will be less US Jews available willing to immigrate to Israel. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Secondly, Israel depends 
      on the US for its survival, both political and economic. Without US 
      backing Israel cannot maintain the high standard of living of its 
      population and the defense expenditure for its huge military arsenal. &nbsp;USA 
      has its own problem and cannot support the Zionist state forever. At 
      present 16 percent of Americans live in poverty and it is doubtful how 
      long US shall be willing to support Israel with billions of US dollar, 
      although USA has heavily supported Israel through financial aid with 
      perennial aid packages continuously, over $3 billion per annum. No super 
      power can survive by spending on armaments ignoring its own population. 
      The erstwhile Soviet Union is the glaring example. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Thirdly, Israel cannot 
      win a long drawn conventional war with the Arabs and she is not in a 
      position to use nuclear weapons in any regional conflict between her and 
      the neighboring Arab states as such a strike would effect Israel in the 
      same manner as Beirut, Damascus, Amman and Cairo which all fall within a 
      radius of 400 kilo meter of Tel Aviv. Furthermore, Israel is situated in 
      close proximity to Saudi Arabia, Cyprus and Turkey and any use of nuclear 
      weapons would have an adverse effect on her as also these countries and 
      permanently close the door of peace and lasting settlement of conflict in 
      the region. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Finally, the US would not 
      possibly agree with the Israel to use nuclear weapons as it would threaten 
      its vital economic interest of the West in the region and likely to bear 
      upon Israel all the economic, political and military influence deterring 
      her from such disastrous action. US has substantial investment in the 
      region and should its interest ever be threatened or should there ever be 
      a conflict between the permanent interests of the USA in the Middle East 
      and the existence of Israel, America would undoubtedly forgo the latter 
      for sheer self-interest. Control over the Middle East and its vital 
      resources are essential in maintaining American dominance worldwide. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">This is aptly proved by 
      the fact that US public leader Nahum Goldmann became a nagging critic of 
      the abuse of Jewish power. He said: The time may not far off when American 
      public opinion will be sick and tired of the demand of Israel [Edward 
      Tivnan, <i>The Lobby: Jewish Political Power &amp; American Foreign Policy</i>, 
      Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc.1230 Avenue of the Americas, New York, 1987, p 255].</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">The Jews are also being 
      isolated. Richard H. Curtiss writing on anti-Arab and pro-Palestinian 
      demonstrations in US commented that Washington demonstration in April 2002 
      in support of Israel appeared to be a ‘100 percent Jewish’ whereas 
      demonstration in support of Palestinians was a composition of ‘not just 
      Arab Americans but everyone, regardless of background’ [Richard H. Curtiss,
      <i>Demonstrations Test American Support</i>, Arab News, Saudi Arabia, 
      quoted in The New Nation, 27 April 2004]. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Israel is also 
      apprehending that it is losing sympathy of the West. Reuters from 
      Jerusalem on 14 October 2004 quoting a 10 year forecast prepared by 
      Israel’s Foreign Ministry reported that “Israel could end up on a 
      collusion course with the European Union and face sanctions like the 
      apartheid era South Africa unless the Israel-Palestinian conflict is 
      resolved” [<i>Israel Europe could be on collusion course over Palestinian 
      issue</i>, The New Nation, 15 October 2004].</p>
      <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">This is 
      the position of Israel vis a vis US and EU. Israel is surely aware of the 
      dictum: (States) have no perpetual friends’ only perpetual interests. Will 
      Israel come to its sense and take lesson from the history? </span></td>
