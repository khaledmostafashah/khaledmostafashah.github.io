    <td width="100%"> <div align="justify"><font size="4">The website of Mr. Shah 
        Abdul Halim has been transferred from <a href="geocities.com/sah1947">geocities.com/sah1947</a> 
        to shahfoundationbd.org/shahabdulhalim. It has, really, been a positive 
        development &#8211; shifting to a registered domain, a brighter opportunity 
        of broader bandwidth, and possibly exposure to larger audience. In this 
        website, the writings of Mr. Halim will be kept side by side with the 
        poetry of his mother Mrs. Anwara Mannan and the articles of his elder 
        brother Mr. <a href="../hannan/index.html">Shah Abdul Hannan</a>. </font></div>
      <font size="4">
      <p align="justify">Now, what is new about this update? Apart from the full 
        content of geocities.com/sah1947 this site contains the full text of Mr 
        Halim&#8217;s new books, side by side the Bangla and English articles 
        that he has written for different dailies over the last years.</p>
      <p align="justify">I&#8217;m not going to make any 
        comment about the quality or literary value of the writings of Mr. Shah 
        Abdul Halim. I&#8217;d rather like to tell just a few words about Mr. Halim, 
        that I know him as a man of dignity, self-righteousness, truthfulness, 
        honesty, ideology, religiousness, and above all a kind heart. He has ever 
        been a worrier against social evils and dishonesty.</p>
      </font> <p align="justify"><font size="4">I've found Mr. Shah 
        Abdul Halim as an excellent friend and a good guide. May Allah (SWT) grace 
        him for all his efforts in His path, and forgive him for his mistakes.
