mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">Can Israel protect itself from the popular Palestinian
      uprising and reprisal by using brutal force, military power, Western
      protection and Gobbles propaganda, this question is often been raised by
      the geo-political strategists and commentators. Several factors are not in
      Israel’s favor. <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">The most
      important factor is demographic</span>. The birth rate of the Palestinian
      Muslims is much more than the Jews settled in Israel and within next 50
      years the Muslim population will out number the Jews in the state of
      Israel (Ibrahim M. Abu Rabi. Globalization: A Contemporary Islamic
      Response. p 35.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The American
      Journal of Islamic Social Sciences. No.3. Vol. 15. 1998. IIIT, USA &amp;
      Lee Hockstader in The Washington Post of Sunday 16 August 1998 quoted in
      Impact International UK. Vol. 28. No. 12. December 1998). Although Israel
      initially attracted diverse population from many corners of the world i.e.
      from Arab world, Eastern Europe, former Soviet Union and Ethiopia, the
      majority of the Jews from West Europe and North America have so far shown
      no real intention of migrating to and living in Israel. Jews are reluctant
      to come to settle in Israel any more. The Russian Jews now prefer to
      settle in U.S.A. for a better living than settle in their dreamland
      Israel. This is because they no more feel secure in Israel. Israelis are
      now holding duel nationality. According to statistics provided by the
      Liberty for the Muslim World U.K, an organization working for the
      protection of human rights and democratization, a million Jews have duel
      Israel-American citizenship and a huge number of South African Jews hold
      two passports and they are ready to leave Israel any moment as they feel
      insecure in violent ridden Zionist state. Constant conflict has destroyed
      their peace of mind and most of the Jews now consider Israel as the
      ‘most dangerous place in the world for a Jew’. This has now become
      manifest from their behavior. <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Secondly</span>,
      Israel depends on the US for its survival, both political and economic.
      With out U.S. backing Israel cannot maintain the high standard of living
      of its population and the defense expenditure for its huge military
      arsenal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>U.S.A. has its own
      problem and cannot support the Zionist state forever. At present 16
      percent of Americans live in poverty and it is doubtful how long U.S.
      shall be willing to support Israel with billions of U.S. dollar although
      U.S.A. has heavily supported Israel through financial aid with perennial
      aid packages continuously, over $3 billion per annum. No super power can
      survive by spending on armaments ignoring its own population. The
      erstwhile Soviet Union is the glaring example. <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Thirdly</span>,
      Israel cannot win a long drawn conventional war with the Arabs and she is
      not in a position to use nuclear weapons in any regional conflict between
      her and the neighboring Arab states as such a strike would effect Israel
      in the same manner as Beirut, Damascus, Amman and Cairo which all fall
      within a radius of 400 kilo meter of Tel Aviv. <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Furthermore</span>,
      Israel is situated in close proximity to Saudi Arabia, Cyprus and Turkey
      and any use of nuclear weapons would have an adverse effect on her as also
      these countries and permanently close the door of peace and lasting
      settlement of conflict in the region. <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Finally,</span>
      the U.S. would not possibly agree with the Israel to use nuclear weapons
      as it would threaten its vital economic interest of the West in the region
      and likely to bear upon Israel all the economic, political and military
      influence deterring her from such disastrous action. U.S. has substantial
      investment in the region and should its interest ever be threatened or
      should there ever be a conflict between the permanent interests of the
      U.S.A. in the Middle East and the existence of Israel, America would
      undoubtedly forgo the latter for sheer self-interest. Control over the
      Middle East and its vital resources are essential in maintaining American
      dominance worldwide. Israel is surely aware of the dictum: (States) have
      no perpetual friends’ only perpetual interests. Will Israel come to its
      sense and take lesson from the history?</span></td>
