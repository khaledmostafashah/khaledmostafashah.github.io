      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">To be able to write a 
      piece in remembrance of Dr. Hasan Zaman who has guided me in my youth is 
      something great. I feel honored on being requested to write a few words 
      about Dr. Zaman.&nbsp; I know him as I was his student. I also know him as I 
      was a cultural worker during the student days. I have not maintained any 
      diary of my student life in the Dhaka University and indeed now it is 
      difficult to recollect memories after 34 years.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">I did my Masters in 
      Political Science from Dhaka University in 1970 and the last time I saw 
      Dr. Zaman was possibly in late July or early August 1971 when I returned 
      to Dhaka after staying four-five months in my village home at Kishorgonj. 
      I cannot however recollect, after so many years, when I first mat Dr. 
      Hasan Zaman, was it in the University as a student or outside the 
      University as a cultural worker. &nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">I still remember that we- 
      A. W. M. Sanaullah. Muhammad Mahbubul Huq and Shamsud Dowla - used to meet 
      Dr. Zaman and exchanged views on the cultural conflicts in our national 
      life and the impending responsibility we have to shoulder. We formed a 
      cultural organization- Muktabuddhi Shahittya Sangha- to work in the 
      cultural arena. Dr. Zaman was its Chief Advisor. Other members of the 
      Council of Advisors were Prof. Matiur Rahman, Syed Ahmad and Chowdhury 
      Mueen-Uddin. I was its Director. Members of the Executive Committee inter 
      alia include Shamsud Dowla, Sk. Enamul Haque, M. A. Azam, A. W. M. 
      Sanaullah, Muhammad Mahbubul Huq and&nbsp; &nbsp;Muhammad Ehsanul Huq We brought out 
      a literary magazine- Kalakantha- that was jointly edited by A. W. M. 
      Sanaullah and Shamsud Dowla. Dr. Hasan Zaman was very happy to see the 
      quality of the magazine that was printed from Alexandra Press at 244 
      Nawabpur Road, Dhaka. Dr. Zaman had a superb aesthetic sense of beauty and 
      he always liked quality production. &nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Dr. Zaman had a very 
      charismatic character, an amiable and impressive person. He used to 
      influence anybody who would meet him. He had a broad heart and would help 
      anybody who would approach him. I still vividly recollect that such people 
      visited him in the office of the Bureau of National Reconstruction of 
      which he was Director, who had been poles apart from him, held views 
      ideologically different from him, but Dr. Zaman would not mind to render 
      all kinds of assistance. I myself could visit the then West Pakistan on 
      student exchange program due to his kind help.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Indeed he was a good 
      speaker and of all the teachers at the Dhaka University he impressed and 
      influenced me most. He used to teach Plato and would tell us to follow his 
      teaching method so that in the same way we can study Aristotle and 
      Socrates. He used to take the class of the Islamic Political Theory even 
      when he was employed in a job outside the University on lean. He was very 
      popular among the students. The class of Islamic Political Theory was open 
      to all; any student of the University could attend. The class of this 
      paper he used to take in room number 1022, the biggest room in the ground 
      floor of Dhaka University and the room always remained packed up with 
      students when he took class of this paper and was even attended by such 
      students who used to differ with him on many counts. He advised me to 
      write a book on Islamic Political Theory. I thought I am not competent for 
      the job but he insisted that I should write a text book on Islamic 
      Political Theory which for various reasons I could not write until today. 
      &nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">He was a progressive 
      thinker and a scholar. As early as sixties he emphasized the significance 
      women’s empowerment and vocal about the importance of women’s 
      participation in the public life. In December 1969 he gave me a book 
      ‘Women in Islamic Society’ by Dr. Umar Baron Ehrenfels. This book while 
      discussing the status of women in the Muslim countries emphasized in 
      making clear distinction between the pristine doctrine of Islam and the 
      legacy of <i>jahiliyya,</i> the cultural practice of the pre-Islamic 
      period that still persists in Muslim lands and later penetration of alien 
      cultural influence in the Muslim societies. &nbsp;As back as 1969 he could 
      visualize the future issues that the Muslim world would confront, issues 
      which we are discussing now and trying to resolve. He had deep 
      understanding of the crisis of the Muslim world and was keen to make his 
      pupils aware of the social ills. Indeed he was a great visionary. &nbsp;</p>

      apprehension that a ‘sovereign’ Bangladesh might become an Indian market 
      has proved true. To day we have a trade deficit with India of three
