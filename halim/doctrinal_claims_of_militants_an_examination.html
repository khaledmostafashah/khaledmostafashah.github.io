    <td width="100%"> <p align="justify" style="text-align:justify">Why there 
        is rise of militancy in Muslim countries which are not under direct western 
        occupation? This question is frequently been raised by well-meaning persons. 
        People often also argue that there is justification for armed revolt against 
        foreign occupation as in Palestine, Iraq, Afghanistan, Kashmir or Chechnya, 
        but why then there is growth of militant groups in Muslim countries like 
        Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Bangladesh? Why such militant groups in Muslim 
        countries target their own people, the co-citizens rather than those foreign 
        powers that maintain and protect stooge agent governments in the Muslim 
        countries? This needs an in-depth analysis. </p>
      <p align="justify">Most of the Muslim countries are in truth run by non-representative 
        governments not accountable to the people, autocrats and dictators. People 
        in the Muslim countries live in hopeless conditions. Abject poverty, cronyism, 
        corruption and misrule are inseparable part of life of the people of the 
        Muslim World. </p>
      <p align="justify">The prevailing conditions in the Muslim countries encourage 
        dissatisfied small splinter Muslim groups to take up arms for they found 
        that mainstream major Islamic groups have failed to come to power through 
        electoral process. The militants thought that trying to resolve problems 
        by armed revolt is the most easy and surest way to mitigate the heartbroken 
        and miserable condition of their people. This is the rationale provided 
        by most of the analysts for the rise of militant groups in the Muslim 
        countries not under foreign occupation. </p>
      <p align="justify">No doubt this is a very simplistic analysis and the issue 
        of the growth of militancy needs further studies from different angles. 
        In this article I shall discuss the growth of militancy <br>
        in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Bangladesh and try to analyze by giving examples 
        why apparently good Muslims took recourse to such deviant way which caused 
        bloodshed of the innocent lives. I shall also fallback on the earlier 
        history and discuss the mistakes committed by the Khawaarij during the 
        time of Caliph Ali for the fact that the militants in our time are also 
        trying to use (rather misuse) Islamic arguments in support of their activities. 
      </p>
      <p align="justify">The Khawaarij, very pious and righteous individuals outwardly 
        and known for strict observance of obligatory duties of Islam, misinterpreted 
        the verse of the Quran: Whoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed 
        are disbelievers (Kafirs) [5: 44]. Islamic scholars have differentiated 
        between disbelief in action (Kufr Amali) and disbelief in heart (Kufr 
        Qalbi). A Muslim may commit such wrong like drinking alcohol or may have 
        been involved in fornication, stealing or lying etc. and thus be like 
        a disbeliever in his outer actions but such acts in themselves do not 
        automatically expel him from the ranks of the believing Muslims. It is 
        wrong and indeed nonsensical to exclude people from the fold of Islam 
        and Ummah simply because they have wronged themselves. In juristic (Fiqh) 
        language, Kurf signifies the rejection and denial of Allah and His Messengers. 
        Al Quran states: Anyone who denies Allah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, 
        and the Day of Judgment, has indeed gone far astray [4: 136].</p>
      <p align="justify">The distinction between disbelief in deed (Kufr Amali) 
        and disbelief in heart (Kufr Qalbi) is a fundamental concept of great 
        importance in Islam. The misunderstanding of this concept has led to destructive 
        forms of sectarianism in the past as well as in the present. In fact the 
        breaking away of the first sect from the main body of Islam was the direct 
        outcome of this misunderstanding. </p>
      <p align="justify">During the battle of Siffin between the supporters of 
        Ali and Muaawiyah negotiations were held that led to a truce between warring 
        parties. However some of the supporters of Ali broke away from his camp 
        saying that negotiations, in their view, were not as per the Book of Allah, 
        the Quran and declared both sides as disbelievers (Kafirs). Later the 
        Khawaarij developed their own set of beliefs notable among which was the 
        concept that anyone who committed a major sin becomes a real disbeliever 
        (Kafir). They therefore concluded that the wealth and blood of such Muslims 
        do not deserve protection from individual Muslim or groups and they could 
        take any action against them. On the basis of this wrong interpretation 
        the Khawaarij let loose a reign of terror on the then Muslim Ummah committing 
        atrocities. </p>
      <p align="justify">In eighties in Egypt a group of sincere Muslims headed 
        by Muhammad Shukri formed Jamaah Al Takfir Wal Hijrah. They called upon 
        the people to take oath of allegiance of their Imam Muhammad Shukri and 
        took extreme position in interpreting the Hadith of Sahih Muslim &#8220;Whoever 
        dies without making oath of allegiance (Bayah) of an Imam dies as those 
        of the time of pre-Islamic days of ignorance (Jahiliyah)&#8221; to mean 
        that those that die without making oath of allegiance to their Imam Muhammad 
        Shukri died in a state of disbelief (Kufr). They also believed that those 
        who were living and did not know about Muhammad Shukri were of doubtful 
        faith (Iman), while those who knew him and did not make pledge were complete 
        disbelievers (Kafir). Thus when Sheikh Muhammad Al Dhahabi, a distinguished 
        Islamic scholar and a former Egyptian Minister for Endowments, wrote a 
        pamphlet denouncing Jamaah Al Takfir Wal Hijrah and warned the people 
        and mosque prayer leaders (Masjid Imams) of the heretic view of Muhammad 
        Shukri and Jamaah Al Takfir Wal Hijrah, some of the followers of Muhammad 
        Shukri kidnapped Sheikh Muhammad Al Dhahabi and executed him. As a result 
        this group was banned by the Egyptian Government in 1978 and Muhammad 
        Shukri and five of his leading followers were executed for killing Sheikh 
        Muhammad Al Dhahabi. </p>
      <p align="justify">Eminent Palestinian Islamic scholar Prof. Dr. Ismail 
        Raji al Faruqi has rightly pointed out that excessiveness or inordinateness 
        (Ghuluw) is one of the major problems of the Muslim Ummah [Prof. Dr. Ismail 
        Raji al Faruqi, Al Tawhid: Its Implications for Thought and Life, IIIT, 
        Virginia, USA, 1992, p xiii]. Renowned Islamic scholar of the present 
        time Prof Dr. Yusuf al Qaradawi, Dean of the Faculty of Shariah and Islamic 
        Studies, Qatar University equated Ghuluw as being synonymous with extremism, 
        i.e., excessiveness in religion [Prof Dr. Yusuf al Qaradawi, Islamic Awakening 
        between Rejection and Extremism, IIIT, Virginia, USA, 1991, p 49]. Introducing 
        of the system of making oath of allegiance (Bayah) is likely to reinforce 
        narrow-mindedness and extremism among the leadership or membership and 
        eventually create a closed elitist group. Such a group once created becomes 
        unable to benefit from knowledgeable non-members because non-members are 
        branded as outsiders and thus untrustworthy [Abu Ameenah Bilal Philips, 
        Tafseer Soorah Al-Hujuraat, Tawheed Publications, Riyadh, 1990, p 79]. 
      </p>
      <p align="justify">Extremism reaches its utmost limit when a single group 
        deprives all people of the right to safety and protection. This occurs 
        when an extremist holds all people, except those in his group, to be kafir. 
        It would be pertinent to mention here another incident of excessiveness. 
        In 1980 a group of armed people seized Holy Kabah. The group started as 
        a Hadith Study Circle comprising of the students of the Madina Islamic 
        University. This Study Circle later emerged as Dawah Movement with chapters 
        throughout Saudi Arabia to propagate the pristine teachings of Islam based 
        on Quran and authentic Hadith. In time however the dichotomy between the 
        Islamic ideals to which they were calling people and the realities of 
        life in Saudi Arabia caused frustration among its members. Soon an extremist 
        group split from the Movement as a reaction to the dichotomy between ideals 
        and reality. This splinter group classified the Government of Saudi Arabia 
        as non-Islamic for such thing among others that Saudi banking system operates 
        under interest (riba) and therefore it is legitimate to declare war or 
        fight against such a ruler. In support they quoted verse of the Quran: 
        Give up what remains of your demand for usury &#8230; if you do not, take 
        notice of war [2: 278-279]. They concluded that anyone who serves the 
        Government of Saudi Arabia and receives salary from the state coffers 
        were in a state of disbelief (Kufr). This group later under the leadership 
        of Juhaymaan, a deserter of the Saudi Arabian National Guard and Muhammad 
        ibn Abdillaah al Qahtaanee who had been unofficially banned from giving 
        Friday Sermon during Jumah prayers due to the political overtones gathered 
        weapons and occupied Holy Kabah and asked everyone to take afresh oath 
        of allegiance (Bayah). The Saudi armed forces finally intervened and the 
        insurgence was crushed. Muhammad ibn Abdillaah al Qahtaanee was killed 
        during the operation of the Saudi armed forces to take control of the 
        Holy Shrine. Later Juhaymaan was publicly beheaded. During the incident 
        many innocent lives were lost. </p>
      <p align="justify">The preceding incidents make it clear that a distinction 
        has to be made between a Muslim doing acts usually associated with non-believers 
        and a true non-believer (Kafir).</p>
      <p align="justify">It is important to study Quran together with Hadith literature 
        to arrive appropriate conclusion of the verse: And whoever does not judge 
        by what Allah has revealed are disbelievers (Kafirs) [5: 44] for Prophet 
        Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, is reported to have said: The 
        fornicator is not a believer while in the act of fornication, nor is the 
        thief a true believer while stealing, nor is the wine drinker while drinking 
        [Sahih Al Bukhari, Sahih Muslim and Sunan Abu Dawud]. Another narration 
        of this Hadith states: Nor a murderer a believer while committing murder. 
        That means belief has to be thrown off at least temporarily for these 
        major sins to be committed, for such deeds can not be done in its presence. 
        That is, those who sin enter a state of disbelief which varies in length 
        depending on the gravity of the sin. When the evil deed is completed, 
        faith returns if the offender feels sorrow and repents.</p>
      <p align="justify">The Jama&#8217;atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) and its 
        chief Sheakh Abdur Rahman while killing two judges including one non-Muslim 
        judge committed the same mistake as committed by religious heretics in 
        Egypt and Saudi Arabia as explained earlier. JMB chief Sheakh Abdur Rahman 
        like Imam Muhammad Shukri of Egypt, and Juhaymaan and Muhammad ibn Abdillaah 
        al Qahtaanee of Saudi Arabia misinterpreted the verse of the Quran: Whoever 
        does not judge by what Allah has revealed are disbelievers (Kafirs) [5: 
        44]. JMB did not take into consideration the fact that in Bangladesh Islamic 
        Law of Inheritance, the Islamic Law of Endowments, and Islamic Marriage 
        and Divorce Law etc. Islamic Laws are in force. Muslim judges in Bangladesh 
        cannot be termed Mushrik, one who associate partners with Allah as they 
        decide in these issues on the basis of the Islamic Laws. We cannot term 
        a Muslim country as Dar al Harb or Dar al Kufr if certain Laws of Islam 
        are not observed.</p>
      <p align="justify">Moreover we have before us the example Nagus, the Emperor 
        of Abyssinia, who embraced Islam but did not rule as per Shariah as that 
        would have threatened his Kingdom and Prophet Muhammad offered Salatul 
        Janaza for him when the news of his death reached him. Prophet did not 
        consider Nagus a disbeliever (Kafir) although he did not implement Shariah. 
        From this it becomes clear that Muslims can rule without implementing 
        Shariah if the circumstances are not in their favor or people are not 
        ready for such reform or the situation is not healthy enough or conducive 
        for such a transformation or change [Sheikh Rachid Ghannouchi (eminent 
        Tunisian Islamic scholar, leader of An Nahadah Party and now in exile 
        in UK), The Participation of Islamists in a Non-Islamic Government in 
        Azzam Tamimi ed Power-Sharing Islam, Liberty for Muslim World Publications, 
        London, UK, 1993, pp 57-58. Also see Prof Dr. Yusuf al Qaradawi, Islamic 
        Awakening between Rejection and Extremism, IIIT, Virginia, USA, 1991, 
        pp137-138]. Here it would be pertinent to quote one of the earliest Islamic 
        scholars. Ibn Abbas commenting the verse of the Quran: Whoever does not 
        judge by what Allah has revealed are disbelievers (Kafirs) [5: 44] said: 
        It is not kufr which excludes a person from the fold of Islam, but it 
        has an element of kufr in it, because the person who commits it does not 
        deny Allah and the Last Day [Quoted in Prof Dr. Yusuf al Qaradawi&#8217;s 
        book Islamic Awakening between Rejection and Extremism, IIIT, Virginia, 
        USA, 1991, p 64]. </p>
      <p align="justify">It is also pertinent to note the most recent translation 
        of the verse 5: 44 of the Quran. Earlier commentators of the Quran translated 
        the verse 5:44 as: Whoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed are 
        disbelievers (Kafirs) [5: 44]. The verse is now been translated as: And 
        if any fail to judge by the light of what Allah has revealed, they are 
        no better than wrongdoers [Prof Dr. Yusuf al Qaradawi, Islamic Awakening 
        between Rejection and Extremism, IIIT, Virginia, USA, 1991, p 70]. Muhammad 
        Asad in his monumental commentary of the Quran translated this verse: 
        They who do not judge in accordance with what God has bestowed from on 
        high are, indeed, deniers of the truth (5: 44) [Muhammad Asad, The Message 
        of the Quran, Dar Al Andalus, Gibraltar, 1980, p 152]. The new translation 
        of verse 5: 44 of the Quran is more appropriate as circumstances might 
        exist or arise as in Abyssinia during Emperor Nagus where Muslims may 
        not be able to implement Shariah.</p>
      <p align="justify">Islam does not permit killing of persons for not observing 
        certain provision of Islam. Once a movement has started killing in the 
        name of Allah, it has embarked on a nihilistic course that denies the 
        most fundamental religious values. Islamic Law does not permit killing 
        of judges for not ruling as per Shariah. Islamic Shariah generally permits 
        taking of life only for taking life. Moreover a non-Muslim judge cannot 
        be killed for not ruling as per Shariah. </p>
      <p align="justify">Some idealist daydreamers build castle in the air believing 
        that they can blot out all forms of corruption and establish Islamic state 
        and society overnight. In their opinion physical force is the only method 
        which should be used to eradicate evil. They forget the guidance of Prophet 
        Muhammad to Muslims to endure the injustices of the rulers lest this should 
        create an even greater fitna and discord and lead to catastrophic results 
        such as the shedding of Muslim blood, the loss of property and instability 
        and without having achieved tangible result </p>
      <p align="justify">Islam believes in a pluralistic society. Al Quran states: 
        If Allah so willed, He could make you all one people [16: 93]. In Islam 
        religious freedom is guaranteed. Al Quran states: There is no compulsion 
        in religion [2:256]. In another verse Al Quran states: Let anyone who 
        wishes to, believe, and let anyone who wishes to, disbelieve [18:29]. 
        There is therefore no question of realizing Islam by violent means. #</p></td>
