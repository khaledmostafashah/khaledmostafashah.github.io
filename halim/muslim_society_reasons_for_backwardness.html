      <span style="font-size: 11.0pt">In March 2003 my friend Umar Murad after 
      reading my article “Modernism: Islam &amp; the West”, circulated through 
      internet in which I answered all the allegations of the West that we 
      Muslims are against scientific investigation, do not believe in human 
      equality, liberty, freedom and free thinking and that Muslim man treat 
      woman as second class citizen and Muslims do not believe in fundamental 
      human rights, and that Muslims do not value democratic tradition, Muslims 
      are terrorist and blood thirsty, wanted to know my opinion on the on going 
      war on Iraq. I answered Umar Murad after the end of US war on Iraq in the 
      middle of April 2003.&nbsp; I wrote to Umar Murad:</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
      <span style="font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;“As regards the current situation in the 
      West Asia</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt">, I can only tell you that 
      we have to suffer as long as we are technologically backward. Much more 
      sufferings are likely to come. I hope that one-day, the day may be far and 
      I may not be alive, one of the Muslim countries (it may be </span>
      <span style="font-size: 11.0pt">Indonesia, Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, Egypt 
      or Iraq – I am ignoring the temporary setback) will be equal to US, 
      capable to face the challenge of the entire Christian West. I sincerely 
      pray to Allah swt that at that future point of history no Bush or Blair 
      (both representing the cult of Hitler) will not emerge among the Muslims 
      who will do wrong and oppress humankind guided by racial chauvinism. My 
      belief is that there can only be fight among the unequal. History is the 
      testimony of this. So if the Muslim Ummah – the Muslim community - is 
      determined to establish peace and harmony in the entire world than it must 
      become strong, so strong that none can dare to challenge them. I am 
      ignoring the fact that Muslims have deviated from the Siratul Mustakin – 
      the straight path of Islam and are subservient to the West. My firm belief 
      is that if Muslim Ummah really becomes powerful they will not hesitate to 
      reveal their true faith and Iman. What we need today is to make our people 
      conscious and make dawah and dawah – invite people towards Islam and its 
      basic and fundamental teachings. We must not ignore and try to win the 
      silent majority in the West who, I believe, are also against all types of 
      injustices, wrongs and oppressions. Till that good day to come we have to 
      suffer. But ultimate victory is for those who work for truth and justice, 
      this is the Will of Allah.”</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
      <span style="font-size: 11.0pt">Now let us discuss the situation in the 
      Muslim World.&nbsp; Let us discuss the condition of the Muslims in Bangladesh 
      and other parts of the world objectively. My belief is that our condition, 
      the situation in the Muslim World as also in Bangladesh is NOT the result 
      of the colonization. Our condition is the result of Taqlid- blind 
      imitation of the past – as if we could do nothing better than what our 
      earlier generations did or we cannot contribute to improve our situation. 
      Taqlid is the major cause of intellectual stagnation that eventually 
      brought about the technological, economic and military decline of the 
      Muslim world. We left practicing Ijtihad- research and investigation and 
      working for improving our expertise in science and technology and applying 
      those. We are colonized because we left Ijtihad and we practiced Taqlid 
      and NOT the other way round – that means we did not leave Ijtihad and 
      practiced Taqlid because we were colonized. It now must be clear to all of 
      us that Ijtihad is the prerequisite, an essential tool for the revival of 
      Islam in the modern world. The quality of Ijtihad made by the later Fuqaha 
      – the jurists – was inferior to that made during the golden era. This is 
      not necessarily correct. We must therefore give up such idea. </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
      <span style="font-size: 11.0pt">Let us discuss about Ijma. We thought that 
      Ijma – consensus- of the earlier generations is binding on us whereas such 
      Ijmas were reached in the backdrop of their situation - time and space 
      factors are indeed important. Even some Ijmas of the earlier time were 
      wrong – for example- early Muslims scholars held the view that the world 
      is flat – and until very recently Muslims scholars believed that the earth 
      is the centre of the solar system.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
      <span style="font-size: 11.0pt">In the name of avoiding Bidah – 
      innovation- we created unnecessary complications – for example the 
      celebration of the birth day. Celebrating birth day by itself is not a 
      Bidah – what is important - what we do while observing these days. Is it a 
      cocktail party or do we have illegal sex after such functions. If there is 
      nothing essentially un-Islamic within the functions observed in the birth 
      day, there is no reason to conclude that birth day celebration is Bidah.&nbsp; 
      We must shun identifying every innovation as Bidah for in that case we 
      will lose creativity, become sterile and our society will not move. In 
      this connection eminent Islamic scholar Prof. Dr. Yusuf Al Qaradawi, Dean 
      of the Faculty of Shariah and Islamic Studies, University of </span>
      <span style="font-size: 11.0pt">Qatar</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt"> 
      pointed out: “It is wrong to think that Islam stands against anything new 
      or invented classifying it under the name of Bidah. In fact, Bidah is what 
      is invented in matters of a purely religious nature, such as creed and 
      worship and their branches; while the changing matters of life such as 
      norms, traditions, customs and administrative, social, cultural and 
      political practices are not to be regarded at all as Bidah” [Priorities of 
      the Islamic Movement in the Coming Phase. pp158-159.Awakening 
      Publications. UK]. An innovation may be unacceptable from the Islamic 
      point of view for some other reasons for example if it contains an element 
      of Munkar – evil in it or leads to Munkar- evil. </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
      <span style="font-size: 11.0pt">In fact Islam believes in pluralism and we 
      must encourage local culture if it does not contradict the essential 
      teachings of Islam such as Tawhid – Unity of the Creator. This is very 
      important. The attire used by the Muslims in various parts of the world is 
      different and if we look at the garments used by the Muslims of Hejaj – 
      what is now known as Saudi Arabia and the garments used by the Muslims of 
      Abyssinia – what is now known as Ethiopia - during the life of the Prophet 
      (peace and blessings be upon him) we find that these were different.&nbsp;
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
      <span style="font-size: 11.0pt">Saudi Arabia does not allow women to drive 
      car but this has nothing to do with Islam. The Saudi women uses veil – 
      they cover their face, but other scholars of Islam view that such veiling 
      or the covering of the face destroys women’s personality – even some think 
      that veiling is harmful because it impairs women’s vision. Some Saudi 
      women use gloves despite hot weather. This has nothing to do with Islam 
      but a local culture. We must therefore make distinction between essential 
      Islamic element and local culture while encouraging local culture.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
      <span style="font-size: 11.0pt">In Bangladesh we mostly don’t allow our 
      women folk to attend prayer in the mosque as if it is a men’s club. This 
      is a local culture and has nothing to do with Islam. The Fiqh Council of 
      North America, a sister organization of Islamic Society of North America (ISNA) 
      in its legal ruling opined that women can be inside the mosque for prayer 
      or any other purpose without separating them from men with a curtain, 
      partition or wall [Asra Q Nomani. Going where I belong. Washington Post. 
      28 December 2003]. In Medinah, during the time of Prophet Muhammad and for 
      some years thereafter, women prayed in the main hall of Masjid Annawawi – 
      the Prophet’s mosque –without any partition between them and the men and 
      entering the mosque through the front door and not the rear door and 
      praying in the balcony. It is for this reason that the Government of Saudi 
      Arabia in its official degree says that partitions or separate rooms are 
      not required in the mosque for men and women [ibid] even though the 
      practice is different there with the exception of BaitAllah – the Holy 
      Kaaba. Some scholars are of opinion that barring women from the main 
      prayer space is not Islamic. They more aptly reflect age of ignorance or 
      Jahiliyah in pre-Islamic Arabia [ibid]. In Bangladesh when men and women 
      go out together it is man who prays while the woman does not. Women pray 
      after returning home. This is our local culture. </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
      <span style="font-size: 11.0pt">Women are segregated from men into water 
      tight compartments in some Muslim societies. This is a local custom and 
      has nothing to do with Islam. Prof. Dr. Yusuf Al Qaradawi quoting Bukhari 
      and Muslim opined that woman can receive male guests of the husband and 
      serve food in the presence of husband if she is permitted by the husband 
      as long she is properly dressed. In such a situation both male and female 
      will naturally see them. [Prof. Dr. Yusuf Al Qaradawi. The Lawful and the 
      Prohibited in Islam. pp 168-169. American Trust Publications. 
      Indianapolis. USA]. Dr. Hassan al Turabi, the ideologue of the Islamic 
      Movement in Sudan, holds the view that Islam does not call for segregation 
      between men and women. A woman may therefore receive the family guests, 
      serve and entertain them [Dr. Hasan Turabi. Women in Islam &amp; Muslim 
      Society. p23. Milestones Publishers, UK. 1993]. But we discourage such 
      practice in Bangladesh. Imam Malik in his Muwatta- written towards the end 
      of second Hijra century- sees no problem with men and women sitting 
      together as long as women are accompanied by male relatives – father, 
      uncle and husband [Jeffery Lang. Even Angles Ask. p 115.amana 
      publications. Maryland. USA].</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
      <span style="font-size: 11.0pt">Some Ulama – the religious scholars – in 
      Bangladesh oppose clapping to welcome a guest and to express admiration on 
      a speech delivered or for some cultural performances like hamd and nat – 
      singing in the praise of Allah and His Prophet. According to mufti Sheikh 
      Atiyyah Saqr, former Head of the Al Azhar Fatwa Committee, there is no bar 
      in clapping. He said: “Clapping of hands is a custom or social norm of 
      showing respect and admiration, and in this sense there is nothing wrong 
      in it from the Shariah’s viewpoint” [www. islamonline.net/ fatwa / 
      English]. </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">It is 
      most vital that instead of stereotyping Islam we change our attitude and 
      vision if we are really committed to keep Islam a dynamic and vibrant 
      religion and make great stride and advancement in the days ahead.</span></td>
