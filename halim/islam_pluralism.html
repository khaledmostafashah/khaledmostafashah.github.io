      <p class="MsoNormal">To every knowledgeable person it is clear that Muslim
      countries put together are no match to U.S. not to speak of the West as a
      whole. Muslim countries are backward in the field of education.
      Technologically Muslim countries are far behind the West. The Muslim
      countries jointly or singly cannot challenge the U.S. let alone the West.
      Why then the West is suspicious of the Muslim <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">ummah</i>?
      This question needs to be addressed afresh from an academic point of view
      to erase misgiving of the West towards the Muslim world for nobody can
      hope for a peaceful future in the world unless the mistrust between the
      Muslims and Judeo-Christian West is removed.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Why West considered people
      of Timor who fought for separation from Indonesia as freedom fighters
      whereas it considers the Palestinian or Kashmiri or Chechen or Moro
      fighters for freedom and independence as terrorist? Why is this attitude?
      Why is this hypocritical behavior of the West towards the Muslims? Why is
      this double standard? What is the underlined reason? Is the West afraid
      that Muslims world will retaliate for the past misdeeds of the West once
      they become powerful? Is Britain or U.S. afraid that if the Arab Muslims
      become powerful they will avenge the illegitimate creation of the state
      Israel by expelling Jews from Palestine? Are the former colonial
      powers and new-colonial powers of the West afraid that if Muslim countries
      become powerful they will have to pay back for plundering of the Muslim
      wealth and resources? Is it the sole and only reason or more than one
      reasons are liable for the existing bitter and sour relations between the
      Muslims and Judeo-Christian West?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">One must not overlook the
      fact that Western scholars, the Occidental intellectuals frequently quotes
      from the text, from the revealed verses of the Quran and the Traditions of
      the Prophet (saws), sometimes out of context to justify their contention.
      It cannot however be denied that our earlier scholars sometimes did
      interpret texts in a way that as if it was the only valid explanation and
      that the prevailing situation of their time was the last situation. They
      forgot that newer conditions might arise afterwards which will need to be
      addressed by interpreting the revealed text of the Quran and sayings and
      practices of the noble Prophet (saws) and what he (saws) had endorsed by
      remaining silent when certain things happened before him (saws) and he
      (saws) did not oppose them. Islamic scholars of the golden era thought
      that Muslims are born to translate the teachings of Islam worldwide and
      make Islam a victorious <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">deen,</i>
      way of life. The classical jurists took it for granted that Muslim society
      would remain powerful and established for forever. They therefore could
      not contemplate today’s situation where Muslims are living. They took
      very rigid stand on many matters at a time the Muslims were rulers
      although the Divine Guidance is definitely more flexible and elastic to
      suit ever changing environment. What is important is that Western scholars
      are using these very interpretations of the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">imams</i>,
      the eminent jurists and scholars of the earlier generation, to prove that
      Muslims are intolerant. The oriental scholars and Western media are making
      concentrated propaganda to prove that Muslims do not believe in pluralism
      and there is no question of living with them peacefully and no hope of
      coexistence with them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The beauty of Islam is
      that its followers, the Muslims submit if new truth is established through
      <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">ijtihad</i>, research and
      investigation. The Muslims therefore always change their position if more
      appropriate and correct conclusions are arrived after careful and
      meticulous use of reasoning. Islam therefore is a dynamic religion which
      is able to match with the ever changing milieu. The West however
      intentionally repeats the old <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">ijtihad</i> made by some of the eminent scholars and intellectuals of
      the earlier generation of Muslims. One example is that it repeats the
      thousand years old <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">ijtihad</i> which
      had divided the world into <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">dar al
      Islam</i> (the abode of peace) and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">dar
      al harb</i> (the abode of war). The contemporary Muslim scholars and
      jurists have however divided the world into two realms: <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">dar
      al ijabah</i> (the land of acceptance, land whose people have accepted
      Islam and Islamic values are practiced) and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">dar
      al</i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">dawah</i> (the land of
      invitation, land to which <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">dawah</i>
      has been presented and its people are invited to<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Islamic values and practices) [Globalization: Centralization not
      Globalism. p vii. Vol. 15. No. 3. Fall 1998. Fakhr al Din Al Razi quoted
      by Dr. Taha Jabir al Alwani in The American Journal of Islamic Social
      Sciences. IIIT.U.S.]. Dr. Alwani, president of the Fiqh Council of North
      America (FCNA) and also a member of Jeddah based International Academy of
      Fiqh in an interview with the ‘Islamic Horizons’ pointed out that an
      “example of misguided rulings is the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">fatwa</i>
      that countries like the United States are <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">dar
      al kufr and dar al harb</i>, where Muslims have the right to circumvent
      their laws and regulations” [Muslims in the West need contemporary fatwa.
      Available in <a href="http://www.witness-pioneer.org/">www.witness-pioneer.org</a>].Dr.
      Alwani pointed out: “We are living in North America as a small minority
      among non-Muslims in a pluralistic, multicultural and multi-ethnic
      society. Muslims have the facility of opting to live their lives as
      Muslims according to the Islamic <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">shariah
      and fiqh</i>. We need a lot of understanding from our <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">fuquha
      and ulema</i> in the North American environment, and if they issue <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">fatwa</i>
      without studying this environment, they will be doing a great disservice
      to the North American Muslim community. Indeed their rulings, or rather
      their misinterpretations, will have a serious effect on the future of
      Islam in this continent” [ibid]. Dr. Alwani pointed out that “in the
      past, scholars were unanimous in their view that the entire earth was the
      land of Allah and did not divide it into such spheres. Instead, some
      scholars like Imam al Razi considered the earth to consist of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">dar
      al ijaba</i>, which replaces the term <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">dar
      al Islam</i>, and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">dar ad dawah</i>, which replaces the term <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">dar al harb.</i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Dar ad dawah</i>
      means a land for dialogue and inter-faith communication, a land where
      people are not classified, but all human being are considered one family.
      This family has two parts. One is identified as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">ummat
      al ijaba</i>, instead of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">ummat al
      Muslim</i>, and other as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">ummat ad
      dawah</i>, instead of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">kuffar</i> or <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">harbiyun</i>. This part of our heritage and legacy represents Islam more
      correctly than the other part, because the whole earth has been created by
      Allah as humanity’s home. The Prophet (saws) told us that the entire
      earth is a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">masjid</i> and pure. The
      only difference is that in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">dar al
      ijaba</i>, the message of Islam has been established, and in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">dar
      ad dawah</i> the message has to be spread. We all know what the nuances of
      performing <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">dawah</i> are, and
      certainly that misguided <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">dar al harb
      / dar al kufr</i> ruling is not among the instruments of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">dawah</i>”
      [ibid]. “The famous 5<sup>th</sup> Hijra century Imam al Mawardy, in
      fact said that even if we have one Muslim family living in a non-Muslim
      state, their home will be the home of Islam.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The reality is that wherever Muslims find the freedom to practice
      Islam, that place will be <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">dar al
      Islam</i> for them, and there is no need for them to migrate to some other
      <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">dar al Islam</i> for this purpose”
      [ibid].<o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Lebanese jurist and
      professor at T.C Williams School of Law, University of Richmond, USA Dr.
      Azizah al Hibri while addressing a selected gathering in Dhaka preferred
      to divide the world in to land and people where <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">dawah</i>,
      the message of Islam has been presented on the one and where <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">dawah</i>, the call and guidance of Islam has not been presented or yet
      to be presented on the other rather than<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">
      dar al Islam</i> (the abode of peace) and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">dar
      al harb</i> (the abode of war). Yet other scholars grouped lands and
      people <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">dar al sulh</i> (the abode of
      peaceful coexistence or on contractual peace). There can be further
      classification of states in the light of the spirit of the Quran and the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The West also repeats the
      old <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">ijtihad </i>of the Muslim
      scholars that non-Muslims living in Muslim countries have to pay <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">jiziah</i> tax even though contemporary jurists have ruled that paying
      of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">jiziah</i> is not compulsory and
      binding. In fact the second rightly guided caliph Omar bin Khattab (ra)
      reviewed the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">jiziah</i> policy (tax
      imposed on the non-Muslims) and abrogated the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">jiziah</i> imposed on old people, children, orphans and unsupported
      women [Islam &amp; Democracy: Mutually Reinforcing <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">OR</i> Incompatible. p 87. Dr. Hassan Al Alkim. Article contributed in
      Dr. Azzam Tamimi edited Power-Sharing Islam. Liberty for Muslim World
      Publications. U.K. 1993]. Omar (ra) even ordered to pay monthly allowance
      to a Jew when he (ra) saw him begging door to door. As long as non-Muslims
      pay some taxes as a mark of their obedience to the Muslim state, there is
      no need for a special tax only to be paid by the non-Muslims. The renowned
      Islamic jurist Dr. Yusuf Al Qaradawi is his book Fiqh-uz-Zakat mentioned
      that Caliph Omar bin Khattab (ra) dropped <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">jiziah</i>
      on the Christian of Banu Taglib tribe on their request and imposed another
      tax.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Dr. Qaradawi opined that
      it is not necessary that non-Muslims pay <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">jiziah.</i>
      It is enough if the non-Muslims pay a tax equal to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">zakat</i> [Fiqh-uz-Zakat. pp 144-152. Vol. I .Dr. Yusuf Al Qaradawi..
      Bengali Edition. 1982]. Eminent Arab economist Dr. Monzer Kahf currently
      working with Islamic Development Bank (IDB) opined that <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">jiziah</i> can be charged only from the subjects of the conquered lands
      [Quoted in Zakat and the Tax System. Shah Abdul Hannan. Unpublished work].
      Moulana Maududi also holds the same view. Moulana argued that Pakistan not
      being a conquered land the question of imposing <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">jiziah</i> on the non Muslims citizens of Pakistan does not arise. [Rasail
      Wa Masail. p 158. Vol. IV. Bengali Edition. 1999].The day of colonization
      is over. Modern states have been established by the joint struggle of both
      Muslims and non-Muslims. The imposition of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">jiziah</i> has therefore become irrelevant and impractical. In fact
      Islam makes no difference between Muslims and non-Muslims as far as the
      basic necessities are concerned [Al Quran 2(Surat Al Baqarah): 126].<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Islam and Muslims are
      being accused by the West on the basis of the old ruling of the Muslims
      jurists that if a Muslim leaves Islam or converted to some other religion
      such person is beheaded for being <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">murtad</i>
      (leaving Islam). But eminent contemporary Islamic scholars hold different
      view on the basis of renewed <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">ijtihad</i>,
      research and investigation. The West however continues to beat drum and
      propagate that Islam is against the freedom of conscience and Muslims do
      not believe in liberty, free will and choice. In fact there is not a
      single instance that Prophet Muhammad (saws) did treat apostasy as a
      prescribed offence under <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">hudud</i>
      (capital punishment) only for leaving Islam. Prophet (saws) never put
      anyone to death for apostasy alone rather he (saws) let such person go
      unharmed. No one was sentenced to death solely for renunciation of faith
      unless accompanied by hostility and treason or was linked to an act of
      political betrayal of the community. As a matter of fact the Quran is
      completely silent on the question of death as a punishment for apostasy.
      Apostasy does not qualify for temporal punishment. In fact the Supreme
      Court of Malaysia ruled that conversion to Christianity by a Muslim is not
      a punishable offence [Freedom of Expression in Islam. pp 87-107. Mohammad
      Hashim Kamali. Chapter IX. Freedom of Religion (Al-Hurriyyah al-Diniyyah).

      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Mohammad Hashim Kamali put
      forwarded verse 137 of Surah 4 (Surat An Nisa) as conclusive proof of
      argument against the death penalty for apostasy: “Those who believe,
      then disbelieve, then believe again, then disbelieve and then increase in
      their disbelief – God will never forgive them nor guide them to the
      path”. Commenting on the verse Mohammad Hashim Kamali pointed out:
      “The implication is unmistakable. The text would hardly entertain the
      prospect of repeated belief and disbelief if death were to be the
      prescribed punishment for the initial act. It is also interesting to note
      that the initial reference to disbelief is followed by further
      confirmation of disbelief and then ‘increase in disbelief’. One might
      be inclined to think that if the first instance of apostasy did not
      qualify for capital punishment, the repeated apostasy might have provoked
      it – <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">had such a punishment ever
      been intended in the Quran</i>”(emphasis added)[ ibid pp 97-98].<o:p>

      must also boycott the community (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">muifariq

      looked “into the evidence in the Quran and the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">sunnah</i>

      question of death as the punishment for apostasy, despite this subject

      supported by other evidence, such as the fact that neither Prophet (saws)
      himself, nor any of his Companions (ra) ever compelled anyone to embrace
      Islam, nor did they sentence anyone to death solely for renunciation of

      </span>Quoted in Freedom of Expression in Islam. p 93]. Justice Rahman’s
      view is supported by such eminent earlier scholars as Ibrahim al Nakhai
      and Sufyan al Thawri (both held the view that “apostate should be
      re-invited to Islam but should never be condemned to death”), the
      renowned Hanafi jurist Shams al Din al Sarakhsi (“apostasy does not
      qualify for temporal punishment”), Malaki jurist al Baji (“apostasy is
      a sin which carries no prescribed penalty, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">hadd</i>”)
      and modern scholars as Abd al Hakim al Ili and Ismail al Badawi (apostasy

      in character and aimed at the inveterate enemies of Islam”), Mahmud
      Shaltut (“apostasy carries no temporal penalty”), Mahmassani (“death
      penalty was meant to apply, not to simple act of apostasy from Islam, but
      when apostasy was linked to an act of political betrayal of the
      community”). Selim el Awa raised a very rational argument that if the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

      to acquire the kind of faith that is required by Islam, just as “it is
      not possible to spank a child into solving an arithmetical problem. His
      mind and thought must be left free in order that he may solve it. The

      out: “How can it be imagined by a rational person that Allah, Who has
      compelled none to believe, allows us the right to compel others and force
      them to believe?” [Al Mustakillah. Issue No. 96. 11 March 1996. English

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">“If Almighty Allah has
      granted us the merit of freedom, he who wants to believe is allowed that

      of creating us believers by necessity like stones, mountains, and the
      earth, which all fear the responsibility of freedom shouldered by Man, the
      ignorant, the unjust; if that is so, then the exercise of that freedom

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:

      pronounced within the context of war conditions. Muslims were greatly
      affected to see one of their companions desert his faith and join the
      ranks of disbelievers. They were not sure if they should kill him or spare
      his life because he was a Muslim once. The Prophet, peace be upon him,
      explained that one who abandons his religion and deserts his fellows
      should be killed. Regrettably, people of the subsequent generations have

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">If anybody however takes a
      very penetrating look into the revealed text of the Quran, the verses
      related to the creation, the very pluralistic approach of Allah swt will
      be crystal clear. Allah is All Powerful [Al Quran 57 (Sura Al Hadid): 1-2]
      and He created everything to worship Him alone [Al Quran 51(Sura Az
      Zariyat): 56]. He even then tolerated the rebellion of the Satan and
      allowed Satan the opportunity to misguide men and women from the worship
      of Allah [Al Quran 7 (Surat Al Araf): 11-18]. When Allah swt tolerates
      Satan, how Muslims can be intolerant to some people or powers who do not
      subscribe their view and way of life? The Prophet Muhammad (saws) was sent
      as a mercy on humankind and not to force people [Al Quran 3 (Surat Al
      Imran): 164, Al Quran 21 (Sura Al Anbiyaa): 107 and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;

      persuasion and not to force. There is no compulsion in religion [Al Quran
      2 (Surat Al Baqarah): 256]. How then Muslims can be intolerant and deny
      other religious communities the opportunity to live with them peacefully?<o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Prophet (saws) was
      considerate and sympathetic in his (saws) attitude and behaviour towards
      the non-Muslims. Some Jewish families lived in the neighbourhood of the

      sick, Prophet (saws) would visit the sick child. If funeral passed through
      the streets of Madinah and Prophet (saws) was around, he (saws) would
      stand up as a mark of respect for the deceased [Pluralism and

      The Westerners, the Christian and Jews particularly took exception to:
      “… slay those who ascribe divinity to aught beside God wherever you
      may come upon them, and take them captive, and besiege them, and lie in
      wait for them at every conceivable place. Yet if they repent, and take to
      prayer, and render the purifying dues, let them go their way: for, behold,
      God is much-forgiving, a dispenser of grace” [Al Quran 9 (Surat At Tauba):
      5].&nbsp;<o:p>

      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Muhammad Asad (formerly
      Leopold Weiss from Polish/Austria and brought up in a Jewish family) in
      his monumental commentary of the Quran pointing to this verse observed:
      “Every verse of the Quran must be read and interpreted against the
      background of the Quran as a whole. The above verse, which speaks of a
      possible conversion to Islam on the part of “those who ascribe divinity
      to aught beside God” with whom the believers are at war, must,
      therefore, be considered in conjunction with several fundamental Quranic
      ordinances. One of them, “There shall be no coercion in the matter of
      faith” [2 (Surat Al Baquarah): 256] lays down categorically that any
      attempt at a forcible conversion of unbelievers is prohibited – which
      precludes the possibility of the Muslims’ demanding or expecting that a
      defeated enemy should embrace Islam as the price of immunity. Secondly,
      the Quran ordains, “Fight in God’s cause against those who wage war
      against you; but do not commit aggression, for, verily, God does not love
      aggressors” [2(Surat Al Baquarah): 190]; and, “if they do not let you
      be, and do not offer you peace, and do not stay their hands, seize them
      and slay them whenever you come upon them: and it is against these that We
      have clearly empowered you (to make war)” [4(Surat An Nisa): 91]. Thus,
      war is permissible only in self defence, with the further proviso that
      “if they desist – behold, God is much-forgiving, a dispenser of
      grace” [2(Surat Al Baqarah): 192], and “if they desist, then all
      hostility shall cease” [2(Surat Al Baqarah): 193]. Now the enemy’s
      conversion to Islam – expressed in the words, “if they repent, and
      take to prayer (lit., “establish prayer”) and render the purifying
      dues (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">zakat</i>)” – is no more
      than one, and by no means the only way of their “desisting from
      hostility”; and the reference to it in verses 5 and 11 of this <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">surah
      </i>certainly does not imply an alternative of “conversion or death”,
      as some unfriendly critics of Islam choose to assume. Verses 4 and 6 give
      a further elucidation of the attitude which the believers are enjoined to
      adopt towards such of the unbelievers as are not hostile to them. In this
      connection see also 60 (Sura Al Mumtahana): 8-9” [The Message of The

      Zilal al Quran</i>. p 209. The Islamic Foundation. UK. Vol. I. 1999].<o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">This makes it clear that
      Islam is essentially tolerant and does not really intend to fight back
      unless compelled by rebellious circumstances. Now is the time to reflect
      why the West established the vessel state Israel in the Middle East and
      nourishing it with all military and economic assistance against the rights
      of the Palestinians in their homeland. [Time Magazine immediately after 11
      September 2001 reported that U.S. alone annually provide Israel $3 billion
      military aid plus access to advanced U.S. weapons in addition to another
      $84o million economic assistance. Why The Hate? Roots of Rage. Lisa Beyer.
      Quoted in The New Nation. 28 September 2001]. Why U.S and U.K want to make
      renewed attack on the Iraq? The good intention of U.S. to invade Iraq is
      to “turn Iraq into another U.S. oil protectorate” [Mr. Bush’s War.
      Eric S. Margolis. Toronto Sun. 25<sup>th</sup> August 2002]. President
      Bush and Prime Minister Blair are out attack Iraq now for they think that
      if Iraq acquires nuclear arms it will “alter the strategic balance in
      the oil rich Persian Gulf” [U.S. Says Hussein Intensifies Quest for
      A-Bomb Parts. Michael R. Gordon and Judith Miller .The New York Times. 8<sup>th</sup>
      September 2002] to the disadvantage of the interest of the West. According
      to the report of the U.S. Air Force Counter Proliferation Center located
      in the Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama, Israel has 400 atomic and
      hydrogen bombs and thermonuclear weapons with nuclear cruise missiles
      range of 350 kilometers [<a href="http://www.worldtribune.com/worldtribune/breaking_9.html"><span style="text-decoration:none;text-underline:none">www.worldtribune.com/worldtribune/breaking_9.html</span></a>].
      The West is however silent about the possession of nuclear arms by the
      Israel. U.S. is now threatening the world community that if the U.N. do
      not take any action against Iraq for the alleged possession of chemical
      and biological weapons of mass destruction and non compliance of the
      Security Council resolutions and if Iraq does not allow U.N. inspectors (<u>Earlier
      reports showed that U.S. intelligence personnel entered Iraq under the
      cover of U.N. inspectors. Reuters in a report from Stockholm released on 4<sup>th</sup>
      October 2002 claimed that U.N. inspector team members made “too many
      copies of their of the finding documents and passed on to U.S. and Israeli
      military” as is evident from the fact that “some targets checked out
      by the weapons inspectors were bombed by the U.S. and its allies just
      immediately after the inspection”. Ake Sellstrom, Swedish expert
      employed by the U.N. weapons inspection organization UNSCOM led by
      American Scott Ritter “accused that ‘90s arms inspectors in Iraq were
      spies” and the inspectors were therefore forced to leave Iraq in
      December 1998</u>) than it would take unilateral action against Iraq.
      However U.S and its Western allies are silent about the continued
      violation of U.N. resolutions by the Israel. In this connection it will
      suffice to mention that when the U.N. Security Council by an unanimous
      resolution decided to send five member facts finding team headed by former
      Finish President Martti Ahtisaari to investigate the massacre in
      Palestinian refugee camp in Jenin early April 2002, the Israel blocked the
      mission to probe the atrocities committed by the Israeli military forces
      and the fact finding team could not proceed to Israel to begin its
      assigned task. Neither U.S. nor U.K. nor any other member state of the so
      called civilized club, the champion liberty and freedom, spoke a word
      condemning the Israeli defiance not to speak of forcing Israel to comply
      the U.N. Security Council resolution. The Western war on terrorism is
      nothing but a “smokescreen”, as rightly pointed out by John Pilger.&nbsp;<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Why the West is supporting
      client governments in the Middle East against the wishes of the people of
      these countries? It is undoubtedly to ensure their economic interest and
      plunder oil resources of the region. It is the Western desire to dominate
      and control the resources of the Central Asian republics which encouraged
      U.S. led Western coalition attack Afghanistan and install a puppet
      government in the name of resisting terrorism.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">It is high time to review
      the current world scenario and state of affairs. The West is pursuing a
      policy, a strategy to keep the West dominant power. Ever since the demise
      of the Soviet Union, the U.S. is pursing a policy that no new Centre of
      Power can emerge. What the West, particularly U.S. and U.K. is doing is
      nothing but attempt to impose hegemony over the Third World and Muslim
      countries. U.S. and U.K. are now planning to attack Iraq and trying to
      mobilize a coalition of Western countries although these very countries
      are silent against Israeli oppression of the Palestinians old, women and
      children and continuous occupation of Palestinian land, creation of new
      Jewish settlement in Palestinian land expelling the original Arab
      Palestine population from their homeland.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The need of the hour is to
      identify the real enemies of the tension and conflict and sincerely work
      to eliminate the existing bitterness – thus rekindling hope among the
      peace loving people and making this world a safer and happier abode for
      all of humankind. This however cannot be achieved unless the developed
      West makes genuine change of attitude and develop a new paradigm of
      equitable relationships. This would require adopting new policies that
      would pave the way for a healthy exchange of ideas and creating
      opportunities for dialogue between civilizations. This calls for the
      construction of a New World Order where different civilizations could
      coexist peacefully without resorting to war and mutual destruction.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Wilfred Cantwell Smith in
      1965 summarized the fundamental weakness of both Western civilization and
      the Christianity in the following words:<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">“[It] is their [West and
      Christianity] inability to recognize that they share the planet not with
      inferiors but with equals. Unless Western civilization intellectually and
      socially, politically and economically, and the Christian church
      theologically, can learn to treat other men with fundamental respect,
      these two in their turn will have failed to come to terms” [‘Islam and
      Modern History’. p 305].<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The reality is that Islam
      and the West share a common tradition <u>for both affirm monotheism,
      profess belief in revelation, in Prophets and in scriptures. Muslims
      shares many teachings with the Christians: it accepted all Biblical
      Prophets, emphasized moral responsibility and believed in the Last Day. </u>From
      the time of the Prophet Muhammad (saws), Muslims have recognized this, but
      the West cannot accept it. Today some Muslims are beginning to turn
      against the cultures of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">ahl al kitab</i>,
      the People of the Book, which have humiliated and disgraced them. The Arab
      Muslim mind towards the West is depicted in the just conducted opinion
      poll of Weekly Al Ahram, Cairo. The result of opinion poll on ‘what the
      Egyptians think about the West’ reported by the weekly in its issue of
      12-18 September 2002 shows that 68 percent respondents see the U.S. war on
      terror “as a means of asserting the U.S.’s global dominance” and 51
      percent consider “a war against Arabs and Muslims”.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The paradox of history is
      that the West accuses the Muslims of being intolerant towards the West
      whereas its leaders are behaving in manner, which directly reflect the
      prejudiced and intolerant attitude of the Western leaders towards the
      Islamic civilization and their abhorrence towards the Muslims. Immediately
      after the Twin Towers attack, President Bush Jr. without losing time
      declared “crusade” which undoubtedly reflect his subconscious mind and
      the U.S. President outlook and stance towards Islam and Muslims. Following
      the foot steps of President Bush Jr. the Italian Prime Minister Silvio
      Berlusconi declared that “Western civilization is superior to Islamic
      culture”. Speaking at a news conference Berlusconi said: “We must be
      aware of the superiority of our civilization, a system that has guaranteed
      well-being, respect for religious and political rights” [AP from Manama.
      26<sup>th</sup> September 2001].</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">If Muslims need to
      understand Western tradition and institutions more thoroughly today, the
      West needs to separate it from some of their prejudices. “Perhaps one
      place to start is with the figure of Muhammad: a complex, passionate man
      who …<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>founded a religion
      and a cultural tradition that was not based on the sword- despite the
      Western myth- and whose name ‘Islam’ signifies peace and
