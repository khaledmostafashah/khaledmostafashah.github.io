      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">I shall raise three issues. First 
      of all, I would discuss democracy. It is useless to debate whether Islam 
      is democratic, presidential, parliamentarian or monarchic. Some people 
      today are saying that Islam is against democracy. Islam and democracy are 
      incompatible. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Any form of government is Islamic 
      provided it meets the basic principles of Islam. We, therefore, see that 
      our earlier Islamic scholars termed king Abdul Aziz as the fifth rightly 
      guided caliph although he was a king. He is even today considered a caliph 
      and not a king because of the presence of Shura- consultative system and 
      human welfare being the objective of his kingship. This consultation by 
      the head of the state or by the head of the government is obligatory and 
      not optional. Therefore, Islamic political system cannot be described 
      undemocratic.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">I am of the view that Bangladesh is 
      essentially an Islamic state by its constitution. Only thing we require is 
      that we have to constitute a committee in the Ministry of Law, Justice &amp; 
      Parliamentary Affairs consisting of eminent Islamic scholars, Ulama, 
      jurists and Fuqaha, Islamic theologians having the essential ability for 
      expounding Islamic law and being an authority thereon, just, virtuous, 
      abreast of time, having political and social insight, judicious and who 
      command and enjoy the trust and confidence of the people. The members of 
      this committee shall examine and review all drafts acts to be passed by 
      Parliament (also all Presidential Ordinances) and give its views on such 
      act(s) to the Government so that parliamentary enactments are not contrary 
      to the tenets and precepts of Islam. The inclusion of such members in the 
      committee will ensure that the Government is being judiciously advised at 
      the drafting stage so that no law repugnant to the Quran and Sunnah comes 
      before the Cabinet or Parliament for consideration.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Some people in Bangladesh are 
      clamoring for Law of Allah- demanding implementation of Law of Allah- 
      Shariah without explaining or elaborating the idea. Really, we have in 
      Bangladesh Islamic Law in practice. The Law of Inheritance, the Law of 
      Endowments, the Marriage Law – all these are by and large Islamic and akin 
      to Shariah. Allah has given us a lot of freedom to enumerate laws- for 
      example the municipal law or the traffic law, whether we walk on the left 
      side or the right side of road etc. etc. As regards Hudud, Capital 
      Punishment- Caliph Omar has suspended the amputation of hands of the thief 
      and he decreed that this law couldn’t be implemented if people are without 
      food and they steal. Now what will happen if we expound this law in case 
      of adultery? Can we implement Islamic Penal Law for adultery as long as we 
      keep the door of obscenity open such as brothels, bars, obscene movies, 
      obscene printed books and pornography or the government cannot ensure the 
      marriage at appropriate age? Really what moral authority we have to demand 
      implementation of Hudud before creating congenial and healthy social 
      environment?&nbsp; Only recently Tariq Ramadan, distinguished educator of 
      Philosophy at the University Fribourg, Switzerland and an eminent Arab 
      Islamic scholar and grandson of Hasan Al Banna, has given a call for the 
      suspension of Hudud for the time being till all relevant issues have been 
      examined by the scholars.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Recently a retired Secretary to the 
      Government has examined all laws of Bangladesh and viewed that 98 percent 
      of these laws are Islamic in the sense that these laws contain nothing in 
      conflict with the Text of the Quran or Sunnah. Prof. Dr. Yusuf Al Qaradawi, 
      Dean of the Faculty of Shariah, Qatar Islamic University, after examining 
      some laws of Qatar, an Arab Muslim country, wrote in his book ‘Priorities 
      of the Islamic Movement in the Coming Phase’ that he found nothing 
      objectionable in these laws and many of these laws fall within the purview 
      of amr bil maruf wa nahi al munkar - realizing interests and removing 
      evils but were not directly linked with any revealed Text except for one 
      or two of them.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Let us again go back to the 
      question whether Islamic political system is democratic or not. Hizbut 
      Tahrir Bangladesh is demanding Caliphate without elaborating how the 
      Caliph of the Ummah will be elected or chosen and what shall be the 
      qualification of such Caliph and what shall be the qualification of those 
      who shall elect or choose the Caliph and what shall be the tenure of such 
      Caliph.&nbsp; Hizbut Tahrir Bangladesh also did not explain how to select or 
      elect Caliph of Bangladeshi Ummah or how the Parliament will be formed or 
      how laws will be made. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">If you look at the Quran, you will 
      find that Queen (or the ruler) of Sheba was not removed from the throne 
      even after she became a Muslim although she was a lady. Here comes the 
      question whether in Islam woman is permitted to become the head of the 
      state or the head of the government? This point I shall discuss later.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">The second thing, I would discuss 
      is sovereignty. The Muslims largely misunderstand this concept. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">In 1969 I visited Lahore in student 
      exchange program between the two wings of Pakistan. I met Moulana Mawdudi 
      and discussed with him the concept of sovereignty. I asked him: In the 
      matters of interpretation of the Text of the Quran- the Shariah- the Law, 
      who shall exercise the final authority- who shall have the final say. Is 
      it the Parliament? Is it the Judiciary- the Supreme Court being the 
      interpreter of Constitution and Law? Is it the Council of Elders or the 
      people by referendum?</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Moulana Mawdudi did not give any 
      specific or clear-cut reply. He only said that such issues would be 
      resolved once the Islamic government is formed. I believe that the issue 
      is not still resolved and the Islamic scholars and Ulama are even now 
      divided on the issue and it needs to be discussed at the academic level.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">To me the authority that shall have 
      final say in the interpretation of the Text of the Quran is sovereign.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Only recently, I visited the 
      website of the Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan and downloaded a ‘JI Media News’ 
      item<b> </b>dated Lahore 5 July 2002 captioned “Govt. deprives people of 
      sovereignty”. The news item states: “Ameer Jamaat-e-Islami Qazi Hussain 
      Ahmad said on Friday that the government has deprived people of 
      sovereignty …” Look even the Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan official 
      website-news reports that Ameer of Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan considers that 
      the people of Pakistan are sovereign.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">We have to address the issue of 
      sovereignty afresh and look deep into it. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Finally, I would discuss the 
      question of the participation of woman as the head of an Islamic 
      government or head of an Islamic state. Those who object to assigning 
      political position to women forget that in today’s world rulers are parts 
      of an establishment. Indeed government itself is one of a group of 
      institutions that share out among itself the power and authority, which 
      used to be <i>exercised by a single ruler</i>, regardless of the title he 
      assumed. During the earlier days of Islam, the Kholafa-e-Rashadeen <i>used 
      to combine in them comprehensive and broad authority, over the whole 
      Muslim world</i> which no ruler is expected to exercise in foreseeable 
      future, including leading prayers, commanding armies, exercising absolute 
      Ijtihad in Fiqh, and being the supreme judge. From the point of view of 
      her competence, a woman may be assigned some of these powers, including 
      the post of the head of the state, because none of these powers, including 
      that of head of the state, constitute the <i>overall authority</i> over 
      the community, which assigns it to a woman. The Hadith (Verily that nation 
      would not prosper which hands over the reigns of its government to a 
      woman- Bukhari) often quoted against the participation of woman as head of 
      an Islamic government or head of an Islamic state is an Ahad Hadith (whose 
      authenticity is not beyond question) and its meaning is Zanni (that is- it 
      has no one established interpretation) in nature. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">In modern state, it is institutions 
      that rule, not individuals. Women, whatever their number in executive, 
      legislative or judiciary positions are included in bodies and are subject 
      to a system. Laws are codified, and discretionary decisions are subject to 
      be reviewed by those who have higher positions or by the courts. No single 
      man or woman can maintain absolute power in modern state. A woman has the 
      right to vote, to be a member of parliament, a minister, a judge, and even 
      an officer in the army. Which jobs may or may not be convenient should be 
      decided by women themselves- not imposed on them- according to their own 
      conviction and based on their own interests. But many traditional Islamic 
      leaders are reluctant to accept this position.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Interestingly the daily Sangram on 
      8 February 2006 published a photograph, which shows Moulana Motiur Rahman 
      Nizami presiding over the meeting of the JIB Parliamentary Party at the 
      Jamaat’s Central Office at Moghbazar, Dhaka in which 2 JIB female 
      Parliamentarians attended in addition to all JIB male Parliamentarians. 
      Until now, however, female members (Arkan) of JIB<i> </i>cannot directly 
      participate in the Central Shura of JIB along with male members of the 
      Central Shura. The female members of JIB sit in a Shura separate from male 
      Shura. Jamaat’s logic behind allowing JIB female Parliamentarians to sit 
      with JIB male Parliamentarians in the meeting of JIB Parliamentary Party 
      in the same room at Jamaat Central Office at Moghbazar, Dhaka and then not 
      allowing JIB female members to sit with JIB male Shura members in the same 
      room during the meeting of the Central Shura is not understandable. If JIB 
      female Parliamentarians can sit together with male JIB Parliamentarians at 
      the meeting of JIB Parliamentary Party at Jamaat’s Central Office to 
      discuss important national issues, on what logic<u> </u>JIB female members 
      are not allowed entry in the Central Shura when the male dominated Central 
      Shura discuss vital issues affecting the destiny of the Muslim Ummah. Are 
      not these practices contradictory? </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">It is important to allow female 
      members to sit with male Shura members in the same room for that can 
      create condition where female members can make instant query and 
      observation on each issue that is discussed in the Central Shura and 
      thereby enable female members participate and contribute effectively in 
      the decision making process. This will no doubt also make discussion 
      lively. There is no meaning of claiming that Jamaat believes in the 
      empowerment of women keeping female members segregated from the male 
      members in the Central Shura of JIB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">To make Muslim society dynamic and 
      effective, it is important that our women are allowed to play positive and 
      meaningful role as they used to play in the Madanian society during the 
      time of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, not isolate them and 
      force them to live in watertight compartments. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Another noteworthy thing is that 
      Moulana Nizami while attending the Cabinet meeting chaired by the lady 
      Prime Minister sits in the same row with other women Ministers. JIB female 
      Parliamentarians are, however, seen sitting in separate row from the male 
      Parliamentarians while Moulana Nizami presiding over the meeting of JIB 
      Parliamentary Party as is depicted in the daily Sangram photograph 
      referred earlier. It is not self-contradictory and denial of rights to 
      women equal to that of men? </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">You will see from the photograph of 
      the daily Sangram that the two JIB women Parliamentarians are in Nikab- 
      their face is covered. In this connection I would like to quote the 
      opinion of Sheikh Adil Salahi, an eminent Arab Islamic scholar who is the 
      Director of Islamic Foundation UK, English translator of Sayyid Qutb’s 
      monumental commentary of the Quran- ‘Fi Zilal al Quran’- ‘In the Shade of 
      the Quran’ and author of another 850 page mammoth work ‘Muhammad: Man and 
      Prophet’. Commenting on the verse 24 (Sura An Nur): 30-31 wherein both men 
      and women have been asked to lower their look when fall on the opposite 
      sex Sheikh Adil Salahi in his regular weekly column ‘Our Dialogue’ in 
      Saudi daily Arab News wrote: </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The instruction of the 
      verses quoted above is that both men and women are required to keep their 
      eye cast down, so that when they meet each other, neither should men stare 
      at women nor women at men. The natural question that arises is why man 
      should lower his gaze if the face of woman is totally covered? From the 
      text of the verses it is clearly evident that the face of the woman is not 
      to be covered and therefore man has been advised to lower his look. </p>
      <p align="justify">
      <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">To conclude, 
      I want to emphasize that the issues just I have raised need wider 
      deliberation and reflection by the Ulama, academicians, scholars and 
      Islamic activists, the workers of Dawah. What I have discussed here is not 
      the last word, rather the subject demands in depth analysis, critical 
      examination and painstaking exercise.</span></td>
