      <p align="justify">Since the dawn of human civilization men are inclined 
      to think that they are superior to women. Prophet (saws) during his life 
      time was successful to destroy the pagan concept of the superiority of men 
      over women. Since then this jahili or ignorant belief has again reappeared 
      in the Muslim society. The most regrettable development is that Muslims 
      men quote verse of the Quran to justify their contention. The most 
      misunderstood verse of the Quran is 4: 34 which have been interpreted by 
      the scholars of the earlier generation to prove man superiority over 
      woman. <br>
      <br>
      Abdullah Yusuf Ali translated verse 34 of Surat An Nisa is as: Men are the 
      protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has given the one more 
      (strength) than the other, and because they support them from their means. 
      … [4: 34] (‘The Holy Quran: English translation of the Meanings and 
      Commentary’. p 219. Revised &amp; Edited by The Presidency of the Islamic 
      Research, IFTA, Call and Guidance. Saudi Arabia.). <br>
      <br>
      Even in this translation of the aforementioned verse the equality of man 
      and woman has not been recognized. This issue therefore needs to be 
      addressed as al-rijal qawwamuna ala al-nisa [4: 34 quoted above] commonly 
      mistranslated as man is the leader of woman, man is superior or placed 
      higher than woman, man is placed above woman, man is the director of 
      woman, man has authority over woman, man has right to supervise woman etc. 
      Marmaduke Pikthall translated the verse as ‘men are in charge of women’. 
      Some even translated the verse as: men are the governors of the women. 
      Such translation is against the basic tenets and precepts of Islam. Islam 
      does not permit any one to rule over another. No power other than Allah 
      Almighty can rule over human beings. Men are not permitted to rule over 
      women or women over men. When a judge issues judgment all he is doing is 
      implementing Law of Allah. In their joint translation of the noble Quran 
      Dr. Muhammad Muhsin Khan and Dr. Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali translated 
      the verse as ‘men are the protectors and maintainers of women because 
      Allah has made one of them to excel the other’. <br>
      <br>
      Post-modernist Islamic scholars are highly critical of such translation of 
      the verse as it is against the general principle of equality of men and 
      women. Murad Wilfried Hofmann thinks that such interpretation of the verse 
      of the Quran is creating obstacle on the way of the progress of dawah, 
      Islamic call and guidance, in the West. “No other factor is harming the 
      chances of Islamic dawah as much as the occidental assessment that women 
      in Islam are second class citizens, marginalized, suppressed and 
      mummified. The trouble is that this assessment is not without foundation 
      because Muslim women in many parts of dar al Islam are still deprived of 
      their Quaranic rights and status. In other words: Many Muslim women are 
      still living much as they did during the jahiliyah. It is therefore from 
      these jahiliyah practices that they must be emancipated. … It is vital … 
      to contradict the misconception concerning women in Islam. Otherwise 
      Islamic dawah in the West is almost hopeless” (‘Islam 2000’. pp 44-45. 
      amana publications. Maryland.).In this connection the remarks made by 
      Tariq Ramadhan is very significant. He wrote: “The notion of the chief of 
      the family who alone decides for, and sometimes against, the rest of the 
      family … those cultural habits of a certain number of countries with 
      Muslim majorities that attribute to Islam attitudes which in fact Islam 
      reprobates” (‘Islam, the West and the Challenges of Modernity’. p 38. 
      Islamic Foundation, UK). The belief that in essence, in attributes and in 
      conception, men are superior to women is so deep-rooted that even some 
      women came to believe that they are defective. “Such beliefs have little 
      to do with Islam but are products of historical process that not only 
      pre-date Islam but gained momentum after the death of Prophet (saws) due 
      to socio-political realities of the time” (Saudi scholar Dr. Mai Yamani 
      edited ‘Feminism &amp; Islam: Legal and Literary Perspective’. p 295. New York 
      University Press. First Edition).<br>
      <br>
      The remarks made by Dr. Hasan Turabi, which has been endorsed by such 
      prominent ulema as Shiekh Muhammad al-Ghazali of Egypt, is noteworthy. He 
      pointed out: “The[se] male tendencies and the appending customs and ways 
      are manifest in many societies where male arbitrariness runs amok with no 
      religious or human limitation”. (‘Women in Islam &amp; Muslim Society’. p 37. 
      Milestones Publications, London, UK.). <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Tariq Ramadhan further commented: “In the final analysis one must 
      acknowledge that the situation of women in many Muslim societies causes a 
      real problem. This is not only with regard to Western values but equally 
      in the light of points of reference that are strictly Islamic” (‘ibid. p 
      323). <br>
      <br>
      Commenting on the verse Murad Hofmann wrote: “If Muslims throughout 
      history had not adopted the Quran to their macho instincts but, on the 
      contrary, had adopted their behavior to the Quran, women would not have 
      become what can be seen in some places as second class citizens. In 
      particular, it has never been justified to translate al-rijal qawwamuna 
      ala al-nisa as instituting male superiority. This sentence does no more 
      than oblige men to take care of women, with full responsibility, inasmuch 
      as the women needs it and her husband is capable of it. Man is not a step 
      above her, but moves protectively a step in front of her” (‘On the Role of 
      Muslim Intellectuals’. The American Journal of Islamic Social Sciences. p 
      71. Vol. 14. No. 3. Fall 1997). <br>
      <br>
      T.B. Irving translated the verse [4: 34] as: “men are the ones who should 
      support women”. Muhammad Asad translated the verse as: “men shall take 
      full care of the women”. Explaining the justification of the translation 
      of the verse Mohammad Asad commented: “The grammatical form qawwam is more 
      comprehensive… and combines the concepts of physical maintenance and 
      protection as well as of moral responsibility: and it is because of the 
      last named factor that I have rendered this phrase as “men shall take full 
      care of women” (‘The Message of The Quran’. p 109. Note 42. Dar Al Andalus 
      Limited, Gibraltar.). Sayyid Qutub translated the verse as: “Men shall 
      take full care of women with the bounties with which God has favored some 
      of them more abundantly than others, and with what they may spend of their 
      own wealth” (‘In The Shade of the Quran’. p 112. Vol. III. The Islamic 
      Foundation, UK). Commenting on the verse Sayyid Qutub pointed out: “God 
      has created human beings as males and females, following the dual rule, 
      which is central to the system of creation. He has given the woman the 
      great tasks of childbearing, breast-feeding and looking after her 
      children. These are not tasks, which can be fulfilled without careful 
      preparation, physically, psychologically, and mentally. It is only just 
      therefore that the other part, i.e. the man, should be assigned the task 
      of providing the essential needs and the protection required for the woman 
      to fulfill her highly important duties. … the Quran states that in Islamic 
      society men are required to look after women. It is an assignment of 
      duties on the basis of natural abilities and the fair distribution of 
      responsibilities. Each party is assigned the duties most suited to its 
      nature” (ibid pp 131-132). The implication of the verse is that men are to 
      protect women as long as they need and desire protection. Dr. Fathi Osman 
      translated the verse as: “Men, take full care of women, for what God has 
      granted some of them distinctively from the other, and what they may spend 
      out of their possessions”. Explaining the verse Dr. Osman commented: “The 
      distinctiveness between man and women is related to the woman’s pregnancy, 
      delivery, and nursing, which make it necessary that the man should have 
      the responsibility to provide for her needs and the needs of the children, 
      at least when she is hindered with such a distinctive function, that of 
      reproduction” (Abdelwahab El-Affendi edited ‘Rethinking Islam and 
      Modernity’. p 44. The Islamic Foundation, UK). Writing on the issue Dr. 
      Gamal A. Badawi, commented: “In consideration of the physiological and 
      psychological make-up of man and woman, both have equal rights and claims 
      on one another, except for one responsibility, that of leadership. This is 
      a matter which is natural in any collective life and which is consistent 
      with the nature of man. … [qawwamuna] refers to the natural difference 
      between the sexes which entitles weaker sex to protection. It implies no 
      superiority or advantage before the law. Yet, man’s role of leadership in 
      relation to his family does not mean the husband’s dictatorship over his 
      wife. Islam emphasizes the importance of taking counsel and mutual 
      agreement in family decisions [as mentioned in verse 233 of the Surat Al 
      Baqarah]” (‘Woman in Islam’. Article published in ‘Islam: Its Meaning and 
      Message’ pp 138-139. The Islamic Foundation, UK). Eminent Arab Islamic 
      scholar Dr. Hammudah Abd al Ati pointed out: “This degree may be likened 
      to what sociological parlance calls instrumental leadership or authority 
      in the household due to role differentiation on the basis of sex” (The 
      Family Structure in Islam. p 148. American Trust Publications, USA. 
      Edition 1977). The remarks made by Dr. Hasan Turabi are relevant to this 
      issue. He said: “The man is in charge of the family, but that amounts only 
      to responsibility for financial maintenance or for direction or discipline 
      exercised in a reasonable manner. Both spouses should share in the 
      management of family affairs, and have equal authority over their sons and 
      daughters” (ibid p 20). “It seems … that the role this particular Quranic 
      verse has played in an example of the adaptation of the Quran to existing 
      pre-Islamic attitudes. It is high time to go other way and adapt male 
      behavior to the requirements of the Quran” (Murad Hofmann. ‘Islam 2000’. p 
      47). In fact a woman is not her husband’s mere subordinate but partner, 
      companion and aide. The problem of the status of woman in Islam is not 
      with Islam but with the Islamic thinkers’ understanding of Islam which is 
      colored with patriarchal notions. Our religious scholars sometimes resort 
      to fanciful, whimsical, far-fetched and distorted justifications and 
      interpretations of the divine and sacred law, the shariah. <br>
      <br>
      Another thing which deserves attention is that if al-rijal qawwamuna ala 
      al-nisa [4: 34 quoted above] is interpreted to mean and signify that men 
      have a privilege over women because husbands are the maintainers of wives, 
      what will happen if a lady, for some reason or other, is never married and 
      leads a single life or that she is a divorcee or that husband, for 
      financial reason, is incapable to maintain wife and also that wife is rich 
      enough to maintain husband. The spirit of Islam is not separation between 
      the spouses just because of financial incapacity of the husband. Who will 
      lead the family if the husband is seriously ill?<br>
      <br>
      Now if we rewrite the translation of the verse 34 of Surat An Nisa by 
      Abdullah Yusuf Ali in the light of the meaning of al-rijal qawwamuna ala 
      al-nisa as explained above by Muhammad Asad, Sayyid Qutub and others the 
      meaning of the verse becomes: Men shall take full care of women with the 
      bounties with which God has favored some of them more abundantly than 
      others, and with what they may spend of their own wealth. … [4: 34]. <br>
      <br>
      In this connection it is pertinent to discuss verse 2: 228 which is 
      sometimes been confused and man is placed higher over woman in respect of 
      status. Al Quran states: Divorced women shall wait concerning themselves 
      for three monthly periods. And it is not lawful for them to hide what 
      Allah hath created in their wombs, if they have faith in Allah and the 
      Last Day. And their husbands have the better right to take them back in 
      that period, if they wish for reconciliation. And women shall have rights 
      similar to the rights against them, according to what is equitable; but 
      men have a degree over them … [2: 228]. Marmaduke Pickthall translated 
      this verse: … And they (women) have rights similar to those (of men) over 
      them in kindness, and men are a degree above them … . In their joint 
      English rendering Dr. Muhammad Muhsin Khan and Dr. Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din 
      Al-Hilali translated the verse: … And they (women) have rights (over their 
      husbands as regards living expenses) similar (to those of their husbands) 
      over them (as regards obedience and respect) to what is reasonable, but 
      men have a degree (of responsibility) over them … . Sayyid Qutub 
      translated the verse: … Women shall, in all fairness, enjoy rights similar 
      to those exercised against them, although men have an advantage over them 
      … . Muhammad Asad translated the verse: … The rights of the wives (with 
      regard to their husbands) are equal to the (husbands’) rights with regard 
      to them, although men have precedence over them (in this respect) … . Dr. 
      Muhammad Muhsin Khan and Dr. Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali in their 
      translation of the verse clearly indicated that this higher degree is 
      nothing but the husband’s higher degree of responsibility over the wife 
      (Translation of the meanings in English of ‘The Noble Quran’. p 49. King 
      Fahd Complex For The Printing Of The Holy Quran. Saudi Arabia). Abdullah 
      Yusuf Ali indicated that “man’s rights and liabilities a little greater 
      than the woman’s” (ibid p 99. Note 255). What Sayyid Qutub meant by the 
      words men have an advantage over women is that “man who initiates the 
      divorce and would therefore have the prerogative to take wife back, a 
      decision that could not be left to her to take. This advantage, indeed a 
      useful and proper one, is by no means universal, as some have erroneously 
      concluded, but is simply dictated by the nature and the circumstances of 
      the dispute” (‘In The Shade Of The Quran’. pp 277-279. Vol. 1. The Islamic 
      Foundation, UK). But Muhammad Asad interpreted the verse as: “A divorced 
      wife has the right to refuse a resumption of marital relations even if the 
      husband expresses, before the expiry of the waiting-period, his 
      willingness to have the provisional divorce rescinded; but since it is the 
      husband who is responsible for the maintenance of the family, the first 
      option to rescind a provisional divorce rests with him” (ibid p 50. Note 
      216). Thus it is clear that this verse cannot be taken to mean men’s 
      intrinsic and natural superiority over women. Both are human, thus equal. 
      The difference between man and woman, if any, is earned and achieved in 
      terms of professional excellence and righteousness [49:13 and 3:195 and 
      99:7-8]. <br>
      <br>
      Dr. Hammudah Abd al Ati pointed out: “Generalizations have been made about 
      the inferiority and subordination of women throughout history. Yet the new 
      sociological insights into the nature of the power structure within the 
      family may cast some serious doubts on the unqualified validity of such 
      generalizations. Men may have believed themselves super ordinate or 
      superior and acted according to their own definition of the situation. 
      Women also may have behaved at least externally, as though they were 
      submissive and subordinate. But whether they were actually so in all 
      respects and always is an open question. … Moreover, there is a 
      grammatical point that may be suggestive. … For example, the sun and the 
      moon may form a plural which can be called the two moons. It would seem 
      that the referents of the objective pronoun them, of whom some excel, 
      include members of both sexes for at least two reasons. First, if 
      excellence is conferred by God on some men to the exclusion of other men 
      and also of all women (a necessary conclusion of taking the original 
      pronoun literally as a plural masculine), it would be difficult to explain 
      why the Quran clearly designates men in general as guardians of women, or 
      why it allocates right and duties to the male sex on the merit of only 
      some members thereof. Secondly, the object of the verb excel is defined 
      neither by the masculine nor by the feminine pronoun, nor is the content 
      of excellence specified in the verse. There is no direct indication of who 
      is excelled or in what excellence is. …. Not originating in any textual 
      authentic declarations, they must have been adopted by men who actually 
      believed themselves superior to women, in an age when external appearances 
      probably lent support to such a belief and in places where instrumental 
      authority overcast expressive authority. The verse, which is some what 
      equivocal, was adduced perhaps to rationalize those contemporary 
      conditions and to give those men at least the appearance of evidence in 
      support of their views, so that they would not be taken as contrary to the 
      principles of religion.” <br>
      <br>
      “In view of this analysis, a reinterpretation of the verse may be worth 
      attempting. Men are guardians, etc of women because men and women are not 
      completely alike; they are differentiated and differentiable in various 
      respects. Some of them, men and women, are endowed with what others, men 
      and women, lack” (ibid pp 175,179-180).</td>
