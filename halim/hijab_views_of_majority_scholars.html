      <p align="justify">The hijab, headgear or the covering of the head by the 
      women which is sometimes confused with covering of the face by the 
      believing women needs to be clarified. In verse 33: 59 believing Muslim 
      women have been advised that they should cast their outer garments (min 
      jalabibihinna) over their persons when out of doors. Al Quran states: O 
      Prophet! Tell your wives and daughters and the believing women that they 
      should cast their outer garments over their persons (when out of doors): 
      That is most convenient, that they should be known (as such) and not 
      molested and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful [33 :59] This general 
      instruction should not however be confused with specific instruction for 
      the ummul muminin, the mothers of the believers contained in the verse 33: 
      53 wherein Muslim males were advised to talk to the wives of the Prophet 
      Muhammad (saws) from behind a screen. Al Quran states: O you who believe! 
      Enter not the Prophet’s house until leave is given you for a meal (and 
      then) not (so early as) to wait for its preparation: but when you are 
      invited, enter; and when you have taken your meal, disperse without 
      seeking familiar talk. Such (behavior) annoys the Prophet he is shy to 
      dismiss you, but Allah is not shy (to tell you) the truth. And when you 
      ask (his ladies) for anything you want, ask them from before a screen: 
      that makes for greater purity for your hearts and for theirs. … [33: 53].<br>
      <br>
      Now let us read the general instruction towards the believing women as 
      mentioned in the verse quoted above [33: 59] together with verse 24: 30- 
      31 which tells women not to display their beauty and adornment except that 
      which is apparent. The general instruction of Islam is that man should 
      lower his look when his eyes fall on the face of a woman and vice versa. 
      Al Quran states: Say to the believing men that they should lower their 
      gaze … And say to the believing women that they should lower their gaze 
      and guard their modesty [others have translated as: guard their sexual 
      organs, protect their private parts. mindful of their chastity]; that they 
      should not display their beauty and ornaments except what (ordinarily) 
      appear their of (Arabic word used is illa ma zahara minha), that they 
      should draw their veils over their bosoms and not display their beauty … 
      [24: 30-31]. <br>
      <br>
      Traditionally illa ma zahara minha has been interpreted allowing only 
      women’s face, hands and feet to be uncovered. This is the view of Imam Abu 
      Hanifa. Imam Malik and Imam Shafi hold the same view. Imam Abu Yusuf of 
      Hanafi School of Thought is however of the view that women, within the 
      limits of illa ma zahara minha, can also keep their hands uncovered up to 
      elbow (Hedaya. Babul Qarahiya). But others oppose the view saying that 
      face of the woman attracts man most and therefore face should be totally 
      covered. But this view is not tenable. The instruction of the verse quoted 
      above is that both men and women are required to keep their eye cast down, 
      so that when they meet each other, neither should men stare at women nor 
      women at men. The natural question that arises is why man should lower his 
      gaze if the face of woman is totally covered? From the text of the verse 
      it is clearly evident that the face of the woman is not to be covered and 
      therefore man has been advised to lower his look. <br>
      <br>
      Eminent Islamic scholar Dr. Yusuf Al Qaradawi however pointed out: A 
      difference is to be noted here between the expressions, “lower their gaze” 
      and “guard their sexual organs”, signifying that while the sexual organs 
      must be totally guarded without any leeway, the lowering of the gaze is 
      only partial, because necessity and the general interest of the people 
      require that some looking at the members of the opposite sex is allowed. 
      “Lowering the gazes” does not mean that in the presence of the opposite 
      sex the eyes should be shut or that head should be bowed toward the 
      ground, since this would be impossible…. Here “lowering of the gazes” 
      means to avert one’s gaze from the faces of the passers-by and not to 
      caress the attractive features of the members of the opposite sex with 
      one’s eyes (‘The Lawful and the Prohibited in Islam’. pp 152-153. American 
      Trust Publications. Indinapolis, USA.). Dr. Qaradawi pointed out that what 
      is not allowed is lustful look (ibid p 153). The Prophet (saws) taught 
      Muslims, if they had to sit by the road, to lower their gaze as women pass 
      by, Dr. Hasan Turabi wrote quoting Muslim (‘Women in Islam &amp; Muslim 
      Society’ p 23. Milestones Publications, London, UK). A man should not gaze 
      at a woman or a woman at a man so fixedly that temptation is stimulated. 
      Instead, whenever any such thing strikes the mind, one must desist from 
      looking on. The Prophet (saws) advised Ali (r): “O Ali, you must not gaze 
      at a woman. You are allowed the first look but not the subsequent”. Dr. 
      Hasan Turabi however pointed out: “Ali’s report does not mean that looking 
      at a person of the opposite sex is absolutely forbidden. It is only when 
      one seeks sexual pleasure or finds and relishes it. Indeed, in the model 
      society of Islam, Muslims used to assemble freely and frequently; they 
      were mostly acquainted with each other, men and women; they conversed and 
      interacted intensively. But all those activities were undertaken in a 
      spirit of innocence and in the context of a virtuous society (ibid. pp 
      29-30).<br>
      <br>
      Varying on the condition of the climate, heat, wind and dust, women 
      however do cover their face in different regions. Eminent thinker and 
      intellectual and former German diplomat Murad Wilfried Hofmann pointed out 
      that veiling women totally is “a custom that is not Arab but Byzantine and 
      Iranian in origin. Women of leisure and high social standing had obviously 
      found out that they could underline their class by taking to the veil. 
      Making them seem slightly remote, this device would make them appear more 
      rare and precious. And of course, cultivating the veil simultaneously 
      enhanced the Oriental proclivity for jealously. At any rate, it is a fact 
      that at the time of Prophet and immediately afterwards, Muslim women were 
      not totally veiled (and Bedouin women in Saudi Arabia are still not). 
      Indeed, women pilgrims to Makkah must not be veiled because their 
      predecessors, contemporaries of the Prophet, were not when they went out 
      on pilgrimage”. <br>
      <br>
      “On the one hand, it is not without logic that Saudi women go voluntarily 
      beyond the Quranic obligation to cover themselves. If the purpose of 
      covering a woman’s hair, bosom and arms is to save her from becoming a sex 
      object, to protect marriages from unabashed solicitation, and to avoid a 
      vain and ruinous beauty fashion competition among women, then why should 
      such strong points of sexual fixation as eyes, mouth and ankles remain on 
      public display?” (‘Journey to Islam’ pp 78-79. The Islamic Foundation, 
      UK).<br>
      <br>
      Nonetheless it should be kept in mind that a person is identified by the 
      face. Modern psychologists and public relations experts study face to 
      ascertain the character and mental makeup of the individual. Face is the 
      reflection of personality. Forcing women to totally veil or cover their 
      face in fact tantamount to destruction of the personality of the women. A 
      woman however has the inalienable fundamental rights to live in a society 
      which allows her to blossom. Woman like man can however expose her 
      personality not through nakedness but through decent adornment and 
      covering of the body. Al Quran states: O you children of Adam! We have 
      bestowed raiment upon you to cover your shame as well as to be an 
      adornment to you, but the raiment of righteousness- that is best. Such are 
      among the Signs of Allah that they may receive admonition! O you children 
      of Adam! Let not Satan seduce you in the same manner as he got your 
      parents out of the Garden, stripping them of their raiment, to expose 
      their shame: for he and his tribe see you from a position where you cannot 
      see them: We made the Satans friends (only) to those without faith” [7: 
      26-27].</td>
