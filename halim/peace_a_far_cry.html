      <p class="MsoBodyText">Martin Luther King Jr. once remarked: ‘Injustice
      anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere’. We should therefore strive
      so that injustice is wiped out from the global society. But when such
      injustice is inflicted on the weak by the powerful or on the poor by the
      rich we try to justify them on different alibi. This is true both in case
      of relations between individuals and between nations and states. Though
      unwelcome, this is undoubtedly the real phenomenon of modern life and
      society. We therefore see that US, to protect its sheer national interest
      or the interest of the West as a whole, take unjustified actions in
      violation of international law and UN Charter against the poor Third World
      countries, some times in association with its allies and under the cover
      of UN flag, to protect what it calls global freedom, democracy and human
      rights and fight against poverty, disease and terrorism. Third World
      countries trying to assert freedom and sovereignty and resist the cultural
      domination of the West are being branded as <i>‘bloodthirsty
      terrorist’</i> and ‘<i>fundamentalist</i>’. The West wants to
      perpetuate their control over the Third World Muslim countries and they
      consider the latter’s attempt to preserve distinct world-view and
      value-system as being inimical to their political power and control and
      threat to their interests. Prof. Samuel Huntington thought that the result
      of such self-assertion by the newborn independent countries, free from
      colonial rule, is bound to result in the ‘clash of civilization’</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">A prejudiced<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>and unfair mind cannot really make distinction between the
      aggressor and the victim. How Kosovans, Bosnians, Chechens, Kashmiris,
      Palestinians and Moros can be held responsible for generating heat and
      violence when in fact they are only trying to assert their national
      identity? If the victims of violence resort to violence, it is mainly
      because justice cannot be achieved by any other means except through the
      use of force or the victims are unable to make grievances heard in a
      political forum or all political avenues for expressing grievances are
      closed. The reluctance of some of the Western intellectuals, academics,
      geo-political strategists, news paper columnists and electronic media
      commentators to evaluate and appreciate the desire of the Third World
      countries specially the Muslim countries to rise against the Western
      military, political, economic and cultural dominance is a disturbing
      tendency of the current Western thought process. New generation of Muslim
      leadership feel that one of the basic and primary objectives of the
      Western dominance is to render Muslim countries powerless and make them
      weak and ineffective and force them to toe to the West’s terms and
      dictates. This has become more apparent to the Muslims after the end of
      cold war and disintegration of Soviet Union, consequently US appearing as
      the lone police man of the globe and Western media’s constant Goebbles
      propaganda castigating and dubbing Islam as the perceived new enemy of the
      Western civilization. The West, because of its blind, negative and
      stereotype attitude towards Islam, has developed prejudice and antagonism
      towards Islam and Muslims beyond the geo-economic and geo-political arena,
      the West is no more ready to coexist with some of the elements of Muslim
      life style like<i> hijab</i> (headgear) being the identity of a Muslim
      woman which they consider contrary to progress and modernity and a threat
      to the cohesion of the Western culture and civilization although they do
      not object in covering head by the <i>Christian Nun</i> or wearing<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span><i>Crosse</i>s or <i>Yarmulkes </i>(skullcap) by the Jewish.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">We shall now refer to some
      incidents, which shall reveal the West’s double standard, unjust
      behavior and Machiavellian character. In 1986 President Reagan ordered the
      bombing of <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Libya</span> from bases
      in UK to punish “evil” Gaddafi, killing mostly women and children
      including Gaddafi’s 16-month old daughter, although US is always vocal<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>asserting that killing innocent civilians for political reason is
      unjustified, against decency of civilized manner of which she claims to be
      the torch bearer. F-111 bombers dropped 32 laser-guided 2,000-pound bombs
      for alleged Libyan involvement in a bomb explosion in the West Berlin
      nightclub, frequently visited by US servicemen, on 4 April 1986. Three
      people were killed and 230 people injured in the explosion. The US in
      retaliation killed at least 70 Libyans and wounded a large number of
      civilians. There was no proof, not even reasonable evidence, of any Libyan
      connection with the bombing. Knowing fully well the innocence of the
      Libyan people, President Regan for political ends ordered the bombing and
      therefore is responsible for terrorist act and killing of faultless
      innocent people. Britain cannot deny her involvement in this action for
      allowing US to use its air base and an accomplice in this barbaric
      killing.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;tab-stops:189.0pt">To
      liberate Kuwait President Bush Sr. and his allies did not hesitate to use
      chemical weapon, cruise missile, indiscriminate bombing resulting large
      scale killing of innocent people. According to the statistics provided by
      Medical Education Trust as many as 200,000 ordinary <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Iraqis</span>
      died during and immediately after the war due to military and economic
      carnage, a massacre, an unequal war in which the West had much superiority
      over Iraq in forces and weapons. U.S. and British forces fired tens of
      thousands of depleted uranium shells, an illegal weapon under U.N.
      resolution 32/84, which bans the use of “radioactive material
      weapons”. Protocol 1, Article 54 of the Geneva Convention states:
      “Starvation of civilians as a method of warfare is prohibited”.
      However Iraqi children are still being denied baby food and enriched
      powdered milk. People are operated on without anesthetic because vital
      equipment is blocked, along with bandage, sutures, medical swabs,
      stethoscopes, x-ray equipment, scanners and water purifiers. Even
      ambulances are banned. Children’s clothes, sanitary towels, light bulbs,
      school books, paper, pencils are all banned. Iraq’s silent holocaust
      began by President George Bush and supported by British Prime Minister
      John Major, now President Clinton backed by British Prime Minister Tony
      Blair are enforcing them. Nine years sanctions have killed two million
      Iraqis, including one million children. After being elected President in
      1992 Clinton, for alleged conspiracy to kill George Bush Sr. on a visit to
      Kuwait, although there was no hard evidence and the plot story is now
      widely regarded as fake, attacked Baghdad residential area with 23 cruise
      missiles killing mostly women and children including Iraq’s most
      distinguished artist Leila al-Attar. In December 1998 Clinton, to divert
      public attention, again ordered attack of Baghdad with missiles when he
      was severely criticized by the Congress and Senate for the sex scandal
      with White House intern Monica Lewinsky and in fact the first warheads
      exploded on Iraqi soil just hours before the scheduled impeachment vote.
      Iraqis are sacrificed for a strain on the Monica Lewinsky’s dress and
      desperate effort of a humiliated leader to hang on to power. A total of 79
      deadly tomahawk cruise missiles were launched in the surprise attack. Any
      one interested to know of the large scale terrorism of U.S. and Britain
      may read Geoff Simons informative, scholarly researched and analytical
      book “The Scourging of Iraq: Sanctions Law &amp; Natural Justice”
      (published by Macmillan).</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;tab-stops:189.0pt">In
      August 1998 President Clinton had to face investigators from the Office of
      the Independent Counsel and he had to confess of having inappropriate
      relationship with Lewinsky to a national television audience. Then
      President Clinton suddenly proclaimed to the world that he would strike <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Sudan
      and Afghanistan</span> in retaliation for the bombing of two US embassies
      in East Africa, Tanzania and Kenya, when Lewinsky was called to appear a
      second time before the grand jury presumably to dispute President
      Clinton’s testimony, a dubious attempt by President Clinton to shift
      public attention and cover up his personal failure, a military action
      exercised to suit U.S. President’s political needs and to rescue an
      embarrassed President. As a shield from impending impeachment Clinton
      launched an attack on Al-Shifa Pharmaceutical Plant in Khartoum, the
      largest pharmaceutical firm in Sudan primarily producing antibiotic and
      anti-malarial drugs, charging that exiled Saudi millionaire Osama Laden is
      the owner of the plant that was engaged in the manufacture of chemical
      warfare agents (VX nerve gas which in turn was producing a chemical
      compound, Empta, which was a vector for producing the nerve gas) although
      subsequent investigation could not<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>prove
      that Bin Laden has any investment in the Pharmaceutical Plant and U.S.
      vetoed request by Sudan, OAU, OIC, NAM, AL for an independent inspection
      of Al Shifa site and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>sample
      test from the wreckage to prove whether the Plant was producing chemical
      warfare agents. The German Ambassador to Khartoum publicly stated that in
      their view Al Shifa was in no way involved in producing chemical weapons
      of any sort. The U.N. Commission (Unscom) tasked with disarming Iraq of
      its weapons of mass destruction had stated, before and after the attack,
      that there was no evidence to link Sudan with any Iraqi program for
      production of nerve gas. The New York Times claimed that after the Al
      Shifa fiasco, Sudanese involvement in international terrorism had to be
      withdrawn because it was found fabricated by their sources; it was an
      intelligence fiasco, an act of blind hostility (Impact International UK.
      Vol. 29. No. 8. August1999. p 10). Time magazine quoting A.F.P. reported
      from Washington in its issue of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>8 August 1999 that Salah Idris, the Saudi millionaire owner of Al-Shifa
      Pharmaceutical Plant, has enlisted the help of a Washington-based law firm
      to sue the U.S. government for 30 million dollars, over the bombing of the
      Pharmaceutical Plant producing only medicine, in an effort to win back his
      ‘good name as well as the money lost when the U.S. bombed his plant’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>On the same account Clinton at the same time also attacked a rural
      Afghanistan outpost alleged to be a terrorist camp and a hide out of Osama
      Bin Laden.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Western record of behavior
      with the Palestinian is also bleak. The creation of the state of <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Israel</span>
      in 1948 by the British expelling the local Palestinian population is
      inhuman and illegal in the eye of international law. No sane person can
      support creation of a new state in the homeland of another people. But the
      West did it and justifies the creation of the new state for the suffering
      inflicted to Jews by the Nazi Germany. One wonders, why the West did not
      create such a state for the Jews in the German land itself for it was
      Germany, which was responsible for the oppression, torture and killing of
      the Jews, not the Arabs. Ever since the creation of the state of Israel
      the West continues to support the Israeli expansion with arms and money.
      US have taken under its ‘motherly wings’ the responsibility of
      protecting Israel and continue to provide financial and military aid. US
      aid to Israel amounted to $84.9 billion since 1967 (in addition to the
      extra amount for Israel kept concealed in the budget of the Pentagon),
      that is 15 million dollars a day and 628 thousand dollars an hour, which
      has helped Israel to build atomic and hydrogen bombs. According to
      statistics of Population Reference Bureau of Washington DC in mid 1995 the
      Sub-Saharan countries with a population of 568 million received in foreign
      aid the amount of over 24 billion. This figure amounted to $43 per
      Sub-Saharan African. Similarly, with a combined population of 486 million,
      all of the countries of Latin America and Caribbean together had received
      $38,254,400,000. This amounted to $79 per person. In comparison, U.S.
      foreign aid to Israel’s 5.8 million people during the same period: for
      every dollar U.S. spent on an African, U.S. spent $ 250.65 on an Israeli,
      and for every dollar U.S. spent on someone from the Western Hemisphere
      outside the United States, U.S. spent $214 on an Israeli. This is how U.S.
      want to eliminate global poverty, hunger, disease and terrorism.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">With this U.S. aid, which Israel was never required
      to repay, she continues harass and kill innocent civilian Palestinians,
      old men, women and children under 18 years. But the U.S. conscience never
      rose during the last 50 years. There are many examples of countries that
      violate U.N. resolutions and as a result the U.S. have ceased funding. For
      example, when Iran was accused of terrorist action, the U.S. stopped it
      funding. When Iraq was accused of building weapon of mass destruction, the
      U.S. not only stopped funding but also imposed sanctions against the Iraqi
      people. The question therefore naturally arises why U.S. is not taking
      action against Israel’s atrocious action? Is it not the U.S. double
      standard and hypocrisy? Is not it an act of duplicity and betrayal with
      the U.S. avowed policy to protect global peace, liberty, democracy and
      human rights; fight poverty, disease and terrorism? In fact Israel
      receives 4 times as much money as U.S. spend on the research to cure AIDS.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="margin-left:0in;text-align:justify">The
      West’s duplicity and betrayal in case of <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosova, Chechnya</span> and <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">Kashmir</span> is also visible. U.S, in the name of not to interfere in
      the internal affairs of Europe, unnecessarily delayed action in <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Bosnia-Herzegovina</span>
      which cost 200,000 Muslim lives and more than a million made homeless
      within and outside the country by the Serbs during 1992-1995 war waged by
      the then Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic (Germany alone gave shelter
      to 320,000 refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina). Prime Minister John Major is
      on record to have said that Britain is not ready to have a Muslim country
      on the soil of Europe while the West by immediate caesarian<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">
      </span>operation bifurcated and split <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">East
      Timor </span>from Indonesia to establish, shall I be wrong if I say, a
      Christian state in Asia with the hidden agenda of having a permanent
      Western military base besides the largest Muslim country. <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Kashmir</span>
      is bleeding for the last 50 years and the West put a blind eye to the U.N.
      resolution to hold plebiscite to decide the future of Muslim Kashmir. In
      fact Kashmir problem is the creation of the British, an honorable (!)
      member of the Western Club. The strategic policy of British and U.S. over
      Kashmir is neither based on the consideration of peace nor legality. The
      West, the strongest ally of Philippine, so far did not take any interest
      to solve the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Mindanao</span>
      problem in accordance with the aspirations of the Moro people. The most
      tangible consequences of the imposition of arms embargo enforced by NATO
      soldiers in U N. uniform was the genocidal war <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in
      Kosava</span> and ethnic cleansing at the hand of same Serbian authorities
      resulting the influx of refugees, driving Kosovas’s 90% population to an
      ‘apartheid-style’ servitude, for the Muslims had no arms and there was
      no way to supply them fresh arms, while the arms embargo gave the already
      deadly armed Serbians a free hand. More than 850,000 Muslims were forced
      out of their homes that took shelter in the neighboring countries under
      the threat of Serbian authorities (120,000 Kosovans alone took shelter in
      Germany). Another 580,000 took refuge in mountains and forests in Kosava,
      trying to escape the Serb military and police who burned down their homes,
      thousands of Muslim males were executed and thousands of Muslim women were
      violated in a repeat of the atrocities committed by the same thugs in
      Bosnia-Herzegovina. Village after village were torched and properties
      looted. Kosova crisis has demonstrated that the only thing, which works in
      emergency situation, is diplomacy backed by a credible threat of force.
      President Slobodan Milosevic indicted by the U.N. War Crimes Tribunal in
      Hague never appeared before the Tribunal and the West put a blind eye and
      until now took no tangible action to compel him appear before the Tribunal
      although US in 1990 found it convenient to kidnap<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">
      General Noriega</span>, which required a full scale invasion of Panama and
      the death by bombing of at least 2000 Panamanians, for alleged drug
      trafficking. The aim of the invasion was to put Panama, its canal and U.S.
      bases in that country under direct U.S. sovereignty and is now threatening
      to put sanction against <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Afghanistan
      </span>for giving refuge to alleged terrorist Saudi millionaire Osama Bin
      Laden. In fact in a rare show of unity the former cold war rivals, U.S.
      and Russia, co-sponsored resolution in the U.N. Security Council in
      December 2000 to impose sanctions, including restriction on international
      flights and closure of Afghan Ariana Airlines Offices abroad, against
      Afghanistan, a country shattered by 21 years of war where one million
      hungry people is dependent on international humanitarian assistance as a
      result of devastating drought.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Earlier U.S. made missile attack on Afghanistan for giving
      sanctuary to Bin Laden violating the air space of Pakistan, a sovereign
      country, in complete disregard to the international law, although West is
      largely known for giving shelter and political asylum to dissidents, she
      is not ready to give such opportunities to Muslim countries. America, the
      country known for up holding human and democratic rights is in fact the
      killer of innocent people and democracy.</p>

      occupation forces are committing genocide <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in
      Chechnya</span>. Chechen Muslims, unarmed old men, women and children, are
      being tortured to inhuman atrocities and oppression but the Western
      conscience did not rise. Although erstwhile Soviet Union did not hesitate
      to give freedom to its Christian states in the Central Asia and Caucasus
      region Russia still occupies eight Muslim Republics - Dagestan, Tataristan,
      Bashkeristan, Kabardin-Balkar, Karachai-Cherkess, Adegei and Chechnya. In
      1994-1996 wars Russia killed as many as 100,000 Chechen civilians, razed
      much of the small country, and in an act of terrorism scattered 17 million
      anti-personnel land mines across the tiny nation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

      extermination and bloody annihilation against Chechnya to take revenge for
      1996 war and for the defeat at the hands of Muslim <i>mujahideen</i> in
      Afghanistan. US are largely financing Russia’s genocide in Chechnya and
      President Clinton supplied Russia helicopters with advance night vision
      devices to ‘combat terrorism’. The West’s response to Russia’s
      Mongol-like behavior in Chechnya is indeed shameful and hypocritical.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="margin-left:0in;text-align:justify">The
      West’s record <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in Algeria</span>
      is no better either. France out of Islam phobia and xenophobia supported
      the military junta in Algeria to forestall the coming of democratically
      elected government to power (Islamic Salvation Front-FIS), which<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>created unrest in that region. On the eve of the 1992 coup
      President Mitterrand told General Khaled Nezzar over telephone: ‘We will
      give you help, you can go ahead...’. Since then, France has provided the
      Algerian regime political, military, diplomatic and financial support.
      France media have also been supporting the Algerian dictatorial regime. By
      extending support to the military junta France wants to perpetuate her
      political, economic and cultural hegemony over Algeria and continue her
      pre-colonial rule in absentia through agents. One time colonial power
      France still believes: ‘Democracy at home and imperialism abroad’.
      France in truth acted against the genuine aspirations of Algerian people
      thereby created schism among the people and is responsible for shedding
      blood of the ordinary innocent people. This is the glaring example of
      France’s hypocritical commitment to liberty for which she is so proud.
      France behavior to liberty, fraternity and equality very much seems to be
      ‘unfrench’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>

tab-stops:189.0pt">Thus endless example may be cited that will reflect West’s
      duplicity and double standard. Although Muslims are responsible for a tiny
      proportion of deaths caused by <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">terrorism</span>,
      that too also to protect their rights and interest, territorial or
      economic, the Western media, both print and electronic, portray them as
      the greatest terrorists although it is they who are the greatest sufferer
      of state terrorism: in Palestine, Iraq, Bosnia, Kosova, Chechnya, Somalia,
      Kashmir, Mindanao to name a few. The limbs found lying in the rubble in
      Khartoum and Afghanistan are theirs; the deaths of bullet ridden youths in
      Palestine are theirs; the terrible burns shown fleetingly on television
      are theirs. According to James Zogby (Arab American News of 26 January
      1996) there were at that time 175 recorded incidents of terrorism in U.S,
      since 1982. Of these, 77 were attributed to Puerto Rican nationalists; 31
      were the work of animal rights and environmental groups; 23 blamed on the
      left wing organizations; 18 committed by what the FBI called ‘Jewish
      extremists’; and anti-Castro Cubans responsible for 12 more. The total
      number committed by Arabs or Muslims over a period of 14 years is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">only

      West’s double standard is also reflected in its <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

      out nuclear tests, U.S. ‘deplored’ India but ‘condemned’ Pakistan
      for the test. American policy in this regard was not even handed. This
      discriminatory U.S. policy, tilt towards India and biased against Pakistan
      is the result of anti-Muslim prejudice of U.S. policy makers. American
      policy in this regard is that Muslim Pakistan should remain perpetually
      dependent on America specially and other European powers generally and
      that Pakistan should never feel self-assured about its independence and so
      remain forever subservient to America. U.S’s refusal to reduce its own
      nuclear arsenal of 8,000 or so bombs and asking other countries to sign
      CTBT and NPT is the reflection of her double standard. When Pakistan
      carried out the nuclear tests, the West made uproar and accused Pakistan
      for making an <i>Islamic Bomb</i> but they did not term the Indian bomb a <i>Hindu
      Bomb</i> nor they name the bomb possessed by U.S.A. or U.K. a <i>Christian
      Bomb</i> nor name the bomb possessed by Israel as <i>Jewish Bomb</i>.
      Osama Bin Laden being a Muslim, the Western governments and media identify
      him as <i>Islamic fundamentalist </i>and <i>Islamic terrorist</i> but they
      did not name George Habash, one of the extreme terrorist of the Middle
      East who is a Christian as <i>Christian fundamentalist</i> and <i>Christian
      terrorist</i> nor do they call IRA activists as <i>Catholic terrorist </i>or

      establish peace and justice everywhere in the world it is pertinent that
      the West, particularly U.S. being the claimant of sole custodian of the
      present global society, must shun hypocrisy and two-facedness of its
      character and make up. U.S. must realize that the days of colonial control
      and domination is over, and no state is prepared to tolerate overt or
      covert hegemony, be it in the form of political, economic or cultural
      supremacy. Trying to block the progress of the Third World countriesglobal society, must shun hypocrisy and two-facedness of its
      character and make up. U.S. must realize that the days of colonial control
      and domination is over, and no state is prepared to tolerate overt or
      covert hegemony, be it in the form of political, economic or cultural
      supremacy. Trying to block the progress of the Third World countries by
      the West is pointless and an exercise in futility. Islamic resurgence
      demands that the West must shun chauvinism and prepare itself for major
      transformation of its stance, attitude and out look and become ready to
      accept Third World Muslim countries with open mind as copartner in its
      stride for progress and development and accept with all humility human
      equality and dignity for that can ensure advancement of the global
      civilization in the new millennium.</p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText">The US duplicity has further been demonstrated by
      the last minute action by President Clinton whereby he withdraw sanction
      against Yugoslavia but preferred to forget to lift sanction on Iraq.
      President George W. Bush on entering the White House the first thing he
      did along with his copartner British Prime Minister Tony Blair is to order
      attack on Iraq. The new US President seems to have inherited hatred and
      vengeance towards Iraq from his father former US President Bush. The
      bombing is the reminder that US is determined to retain its dominant
      control over the Middle East and any Arab Muslim leader who do not
      acquiesce with the American power will be targeted from time to time. It
      is not enough that the international community condemns such attack
      against a sovereign country and killing of innocent civilians, old, women
      and children. The international community should be vocal and demand:&nbsp;<o:p>
