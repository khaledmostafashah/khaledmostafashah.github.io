      <p style="text-align:justify">The Constitution of
      Bangladesh framed by the members of the first Parliament has been
      subsequently amended to bring it closer to the life and expectation of the
      majority of the people of Bangladesh. President Ziaur Rahman, who formally
      declared the independence of Bangladesh on 26th March 1971, made the first
      positive and meaningful change in the Constitution. This he did by
      incorporating in the top of the preamble of the Constitution the words: <i>bismillahir
      rahmanir rahim,</i> In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. In
      the preamble also added are the words: “Pledging that the high ideals of
      absolute trust and faith in the Almighty Allah… shall be the fundamental
      principles of the Constitution”. Also added in the Fundamental
      Principles of State Policy are the words: “Absolute trust and faith in
      the Almighty Allah shall be the basis of all actions” [Article 8(1A) of
      Part-111 of the Constitution]. President Zia introduced these changes in
      the Constitution in fulfillment of the hopes and aspirations of the vast
      majority of the people of Bangladesh and to bring politics closer to the
      real life expectation of the people of Bangladesh. President H.M. Ershad
      made yet another meaningful and far-reaching change in the Constitution by
      incorporating the words: “The state religion of the Republic is Islam”
      (Article 2 A of Part-1 of the Constitution).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">Prior to the parliamentary
      election held on 1 October 2001 both the two major political parties of
      the country have made commitment to the people that they shall not frame
      any law contrary to precept and teachings of Islam. Bangladesh Nationalist
      Party (BNP) in its election manifesto reiterated that no law contrary to
      Islam shall be passed (Article 3.4 of Chapter-III of the Election
      Manifesto-2001 of BNP). Bangladesh Awami League has however gone a step
      forward and made specific pledge to the people through its election
      manifesto that: “No law would be enacted contrary to the Holy Quran and <i>sunnah</i>”.
      (Article 7 of the Bangladesh Awami League Election Manifesto-2001).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">The Parliament shall soon
      start functioning fully in which hopefully both the treasury bench and
      opposition members shall play positive and meaningful role to materialize
      the dream of the people of Bangladesh. The intention of the writer of this
      article is to shed light and propose to the lawmakers, nay the members of
      the Parliament, some specific ideas for suitable amendment of the
      Constitution to ensure that henceforth there remains no loophole or scope
      for the Parliament to legislate any law repugnant to the Quran and the <i>sunnah</i>
      and there should be such mechanism in the Constitution that even if a law
      is passed by the Parliament inadvertently which is opposed to the Quran
      and the <i>sunnah</i>, such a law can be declared void<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>by the Supreme Court.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">Now the question is how to
      ensure and guarantee that no law repugnant to the Quran and the <i>sunnah</i>
      is enacted by the Parliament. What should be the modus operandi to stop
      the passage of such legislation? What constitutional arrangement should be
      incorporated in the Constitution to stop the promulgation of law repugnant
      to the Quran and the <i>sunnah</i>? What amendments are required in the
      relevant provisions of the Constitution to ensure and materialize this
      dream of the people? Mere incorporation of a declaration in the preamble
      of the Constitution that no law against the Quran and the <i>sunnah</i>
      shall be made is not enough, though it shall be a positive development,
      for no citizen can challenge in the court such declaration in the preamble
      of the Constitution that no law shall be framed that goes against the
      principles of Islam. In the preamble of the Constitution of the Islamic
      Republic of Pakistan, both 1956 and 1962, a pious wish was made to the
      effect that no law shall be made which is repugnant to the Holy Quran and
      the <i>sunnah</i> but it was not very effective.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">The government (meaning
      BNP led Four Party Alliance) and the opposition (meaning Bangladesh Awami
      League) may consider either of the following options to ensure that no law
      repugnant to the Holy Quran and the <i>sunnah</i> is promulgated.
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The Constitution of
      Bangladesh, in its substantive part, may be suitably amended to create
      Islamic Advisory Council consisting of eminent Islamic scholars, <i>ulama</i>,
      jurists and <i>fuqaha</i>. The Council shall, inter alia, examine and
      review all draft acts to be passed by the Parliament (also all
      Presidential Ordinances) and give their views on such act(s) to the
      Government. Taking opinion of the Islamic Advisory Council shall be
      binding while framing laws. The Government however may or may not accept
      the opinion of the Council; the people shall however reserve the right to
      challenge such law(s) in the court.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">The Constitution of
      Bangladesh may be suitably amended to form a fourteen- member Council of
      Guardians to be elected by the Parliament, in the light of the Islamic
      Republic of Iran<sup>1</sup>, composed of seven competent Islamic
      theologians and canonists having the essential ability for expounding
      Islamic theological and canon law and being the authority thereon, just,
      virtuous, abreast of the times having political and social insight,
      judicious and who command and enjoy the trust and confidence of the
      people; and seven eminent jurists versed in different branches of law from
      among the Muslims jurists with a view to ensuring that the parliamentary
      enactments are not contrary to the tenets and precepts of Islam. If the
      majority members of the Council of Guardians find the enactments contrary
      to the Islamic tenets, it shall return the same to the Parliament for
      consideration. The members of the Council of Guardians shall have the
      right to attend the Parliament while the Parliament is debating a legal
      bill or draft and express their views thereon. The Parliament shall not
      have the right to make laws contrary to the tenets and precepts of the
      state religion, which is Islam. Courts shall refrain from administering
      the government decrees and regulations contrary to Islamic laws and every
      citizen shall have the right to request the justice courts for annulment
      of such decrees and regulations. Nothing shall however prelude the judges
      from interpreting the laws as to their function of distinguishing between
      the right <i>(maruf)</i> and wrong <i>(munkar)</i> might demand. The
      government while preparing the panel of the seven-member jurists shall
      have to consult the Supreme Judicial Council.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">The Constitution of
      Bangladesh may be suitably amended to create six-member Council of Elders,
      one from each Division, to be directly elected by the people. The Council
      of Elders shall have the right to veto any law passed by the Parliament if
      such law, in the opinion of its majority members, contradicts the teaching
      of the Holy Quran and the <i>sunnah</i> and its decision shall be binding.
      In this case the Parliament shall have to enumerate in the Constitution
      the qualification of the members of the Council of Elders.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">The Constitution of
      Bangladesh may also be suitably amended to create <i>shariah</i> Bench
      both in the High Court Division and Appellate Division of the Supreme
      Court to enable any citizen to challenge any law passed by the Parliament
      for the violation of the <i>shariah,</i> Islamic law.<
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">In addition, the
      Government should include immediately, without waste of time and further
      delay, eminent Islamic scholars including <i>ulama </i>in the Committee of
      the Ministry of Law, Justice &amp; Parliamentary Affairs which drafts laws
      (Ordinances and Acts) on behalf of the Government so that such people can
      offer their expertise, knowledge, proficiency and play positive and
      meaningful role at the drafting stage and give their views on the draft
      laws to be placed before the Cabinet for consideration and later to be
      placed in the Parliament for approval. People who are well-informed of
      latest <i>ijtihad</i>, research being done in various Islamic issues
      throughout the Muslim world in such prestigious institutions as OIC Fiqh
      Academy, Jeddah; Fiqh Academy of The World Muslim League (<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Rebatat
      Al Alam Al Islami</span>), Makkah; Al Azhar University, Egypt; Medina
      Islamic University, Saudi Arabia; Islamic University, Pakistan;
      International Islamic University, Malaysia and important Islamic research
      organizations in the West such as The International Institute of Islamic
      Thought (IIIT), USA and The Islamic Foundation, UK and also conversant
      with the critical ills of Bangladesh and capable<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>to put forward pragmatic Islamic solutions of the problems should
      be considered eligible to be the members of the Committee. The inclusion
      of such members in the Committee will ensure that the Government is being
      judiciously advised at the drafting stage so that no law repugnant to the
      Quran and the <i>sunnah</i> comes before either the Cabinet or the
      Parliament for consideration. The Cabinet or the Parliament may invite the
      Islamic scholars, who are members of the Committee, to hear their opinion,
      if it feels so.

      <p><span style="font-size:12.0pt">What has been
      discussed in this article is not the last word. The writer’s primary
      intention is to create public opinion and put forward some ideas and food
      for thought. The jurists and constitutional experts are in a better
      position to suggest better options and alternatives and workout detailed
      modalities. It is however the primary responsibility of the incumbent
      Government (meaning the Four Party Alliance) to work out the details of
      the constitutional arrangement, addition, amendment, modification,
      alteration and change in the Constitution so that no law repugnant to the
      Holy Quran and the <i>sunnah</i> can be passed in the Parliament in future
      that shall give the Muslims of Bangladesh the opportunity to fashion their
      lives in accordance with the true teachings and sprit of Islam without
      jeopardizing personal and public life of other religious groups. It is
      hoped that the Government shall get all the cooperation from the
      opposition, the Bangladesh Awami League in the matter as AL has also
      committed to the voters during the last election through its election
      manifesto that if it comes to power it would not promulgate any law
      repugnant to the Quran and the <i>sunnah.</i> Although to move a bill in
      the Parliament to bring about required amendments in the Constitution to
      implement the election commitment to the voters basically lies with the
      Government, this however does not absolve the Bangladesh Awami League,
      major opposition party in the Parliament, of its responsibility to move
      such a bill that shall ensure that no law repugnant to Islam is passed by
      the Parliament for AL has also committed to the voters during the election
      that if voted to power it shall not legislate any law repugnant to the
      Quran and the <i>sunnah</i>. Any member of the Parliament, no matter
      whether s/he is elected from BNP or AL or Jamaat-e-Islami, can move such a
      bill as private member bill to prove to the nation that members of the
      Parliament are men of words and are not in the political arena to hoodwink
      the people. Let us prove ourselves to be true Muslims and not hypocrites.

      <p><span style="font-size:12.0pt">1. In the Islamic
      Republic of Iran a twelve member Council of Custodians composed of six
      theologians nominated by the Leader or the by the Council of Leadership
      and six jurists versed in different branches of law from among the Muslim
      jurists nominated by the Supreme Judicial Council (Article-91) composed of
      President of the Supreme Court of Cassation, State Prosecutor General and
      three righteous judges versed in Islamic theological and canon law
      nominated by the country’s judicial branch (Article-158) whose
      nomination shall be endorsed by the <i>Majlish</i> (meaning the
      Parliament) with a view to ensuring that the enactments of <i>Majlish</i>
      are not contrary to the tenets and precepts of Islam (Article-9). If
      majority members of the Council of Custodians find the enactments contrary
      to the Islamic tenets, it shall return the same to the <i>Majlish</i> for
      consideration (Article-94 and Article- 96). The members of the Council of
      Custodians shall have the right to attend the <i>Majlish </i>while the <i>Majlish</i>
      is debating a legal bill or draft and express their views thereon
      (Article-97). Experts elected by the people shall appoint members of the
      Council of Leadership whom they consider competent as to be vested with
      such authority and leadership. In one such authority is known to be
      pre-eminent above all others, he shall be appointed as the Leader of the
      nation; otherwise the Constituent Assembly of Experts (Article-111) shall
      appoint as members of the Council of Leadership whom they consider fully
      qualified for leadership (Article-107), competent Islamic theologian and
      canonist, just, virtuous, abreast of the times, brave, organizer and
      judicious whom the majority people accept as their Leader (Article-5). The

      of the state religion of the country (which is Islam: Article-12) or
      constitutional law (Article-72). Courts shall refrain from administering
      the government decrees and regulations contrary to Islamic laws … and
      everyone has the right to request justice courts for annulment of such
      decrees and regul<i>a</i>tions (Aerticle-170). Definition and
      interpretation of common legislation shall be within the jurisdiction of
      the <i>Majlish</i> and this shall not prelude judges from interpreting the
      laws as to their function of distinguishing between the right and the
