      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">When the next 
      Arab-Israeli war will start, this is the most talked about subject among 
      the geo-political and military strategists of the West Asia. The question 
      is: Why such a war will at all start when the combined strength of the 
      Arab countries is no match to that of Israel? Israel is estimated to have 
      as many as 400 atomic and hydrogen bombs. Enver Masud in his book ‘<i>The 
      War on Islam</i>’<i> </i>quoting Toronto Sun wrote: The Israeli Air Force 
      has three squadrons equipped with Jericho nuclear-tipped missiles at the 
      Sedot Mikha base, some 45 km south of Tel Aviv. The Jericho’s can reach 
      all major Arab cities and even such Muslim countries as Morocco, Iran and 
      Pakistan [Enver Masud, <i>The War</i> <i>on Islam</i>, Madrasah Books, The 
      Wisdom Fund, Arligonton, VA 22202,USA,&nbsp; pp55-56]. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">No doubt a nuclear war in 
      the Middle East is most unlikely for several reasons. Israel is not in a 
      position to use nuclear weapons in any regional conflict between her and 
      the neighboring Arab states because such a strike would affect Israel in 
      the same manner as Beirut, Damascus, Amman and Cairo which all fall within 
      a radius of 250 miles from Tel Aviv. Furthermore, Israel is situated in 
      close proximity to Saudi Arabia, Cyprus and Turkey and any use of nuclear 
      weapons would have an adverse effect on her as also these countries. US 
      would not possibly agree with the Israel to use nuclear weapons as it 
      would threaten the vital economic interest of the West in the region and 
      likely to bear upon Israel all the economic, political and military 
      influence deterring her from such disastrous action. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Israel is fully aware of 
      the position of Washington in this regard but she has the reputation of 
      blackmailing the neighbors by using the bogey of nuclear war. In 1973 war, 
      Israel in the first three days of the war lost five hundred tanks and 
      forty-nine aircraft, including fourteen F-4 Phantoms. In the Sinai, 
      Egyptian forces, equipped with missiles and electronic defenses, blasted 
      through the Bar-Lev defense line along the eastern bank of the canal and 
      soon had two large armies on the eastern bank. The initial Israeli 
      counterattacks by three tank divisions were beaten off. On the Golan 
      Heights, Syrian forces, bolstered by fourteen hundred tanks, rolled 
      through Israeli defenses and moved to the edge of Galilee. Only a few 
      Israeli tanks stood between the Syrians and the heavily populated Hulla 
      Valley. Haifa was just hours away. The then Defense Minister Moshe Dayan’s 
      assessment was: “The situation is desperate. Everything is lost. We must 
      withdraw”. It was Israel’s darkest hour, but no withdrawal was ordered. 
      Instead, Israel called its first nuclear alert and began arming its 
      nuclear arsenal. And Israel used that alert to blackmail Washington into a 
      major policy change, wrote Seymour M. Hersh in his book ‘<i>The Samson 
      Option</i>: <i>Israel’s Nuclear Arsenal and American Foreign Policy</i>’ 
      [Seymour M. Hersh, <i>The Samson Option: Israel’s Nuclear Arsenal and 
      American Foreign Policy,</i> Random House, New York, First Edition, 1991, 
      pp 222-223].</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Political analysts, 
      though excluded the possibility of nuclear war in the Middle East, however 
      did not rule out the option of conventional war in the West Asia. Such a 
      war, according to the geo-military experts, can take place any time in the 
      region and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat is on record to have said in 
      1979 that “the only matter that could take Egypt to war again is 
      water”[Enver Masud, <i>The War</i> <i>on Islam</i>, Madrasah Books, The 
      Wisdom Fund, Arligonton, VA 22202,USA,&nbsp; p25] and former UN Secretary 
      General Boutrous&nbsp; Ghali in 1988 expressed his apprehension that “the next 
      war in our region will be over waters of the Nile” [ibid] .</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">According to the Water 
      Resources Research and Development Agency, GreenCross, the Middle East 
      region while accounting for five percent of the world’s population has 
      approximately one percent of the world’s freshwater. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Occupied Palestine 
      suffers from a naturally arid climate with few freshwater resources. 
      Non-renewable groundwater, low annual rainfall, and only the Jordan River, 
      and a tributary the Yarmouk River, comprise the sources for usable water 
      for 12 million or so inhabitants of the region. Eighty percent of this 
      water is used for irrigation to sustain agriculture. The water is running 
      out simply because of the settlement of the immigrant Jews in the occupied 
      Palestine, an artificial growth of the local population by the machination 
      of the surrogate state of Israel.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">The population of the 
      Israel has reached to six million. The problem is not a real lack of 
      sufficient regional water resources. On the contrary, for centuries, there 
      has been enough water to meet the needs of the indigenous Arab population. 
      It is estimated that the available water could sustain between four to 
      five million people. This means that Israel, with its population alone, 
      now exceeds the available freshwater resources of the region by about one 
      million people. This, of course, is excluding the needs of the indigenous 
      people, namely, the Palestinians, the Jordanians, the Syrians and the 
      Lebanese. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">The entire region will 
      soon run short of water and the consumption of the immigrant Jews are more 
      than the indigenous Arabs and Palestinians. Israel consumes, per capita, 
      about three and a half times as much water as does Jordan, and about 
      thirty times as much as Gaza. In this backdrop, Israel will soon face 
      acute water shortage. How Israel can face this problem? Indeed a problem 
      of survival. Israeli leadership is considering several options. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">The option which the 
      leadership of Israel is considering is expulsion of the Palestinians and 
      occupation of the entire Palestine with the exclusion of Jordan, the later 
      being a US ‘satellite’. Such an action by Israel might find resistance in 
      Europe and even in US. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Israel has recently 
      approved highly expensive desalination plants by which water from sea 
      could be purified for use and consumption. This seems to be highly 
      ambitious and financially not viable. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Diverting water from 
      agriculture but this will further increase Israel dependence on 
      international (mostly US) assistance for survival of its economy and make 
      it more dependent on US for its defense requirement.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Israel is considering the 
      possibility of importing water, transporting water to the shores of 
      Israel. Newspapers in April 2000 reported that little tugboats are seen 
      carrying large plastic bubbles full of water from Turkey for use in 
      Israel.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Israel is also 
      considering constructing a pipeline beneath the Suez Canal to bring water 
      from Nile River of Egypt. This impracticable hope, however, overlooks the 
      fact that approximately 97 percent of the water of Egypt originates 
      outside its borders and there are some nine other countries, approximately 
      140 million people upstream from Egypt, which utilize water from Nile 
      Basin. Ethiopia and Sudan, for instance, have already constructed 
      expensive dams to meet the need of their increasing population that has 
      already decreased the water flow to Egypt. Enver Masud quoting unnamed 
      Kenyan hydrological expert in Tanzania confirmed the truth of such secret 
      studies by Israel [ibid p 24]. Masud believes that Egypt, an American 
      outpost, may be persuaded to surrender in lieu of reward by US. He, 
      however, doubts whether Sudan will agree to surrender to Israel-US 
      pressure. The recent interference by the US, UK and other western 
      countries in the internal affairs of Sudan in the name of violation human 
      rights in Darfur region’s sectarian strife should be seen in this 
      backdrop, intervention by powers that do not seem to have a benign 
      interest in the prosperity and stability of this largest Arab-African 
      country.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">The Kurdish region in 
      Turkey is straddle on both sides by the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers. 
      The region is rich in water resources. The previous government of Turkey, 
      due to internal pressure of the pro-western Turkish army and at the behest 
      of US-Israel, began an unprecedented $25 billion waterworks project to 
      secure control, through a series of dams and hydroelectric plants, of both 
      vitally important rivers. &nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Israel believes an 
      ultra-secular Turkey might be interested to share water of this region 
      with Israel with direct pipeline. The plan also includes a symbolic 
      distribution of water to Syria, Jordan and the Palestinians to appease the 
      Arabs of the region and to camouflage real intention of diverting Kurdi-Turkish 
      water to Israel. US after the occupation of Iraq, however, gave up the 
      initial plan to create an independent Kurdish state by slashing a part of 
      Iraq, Syria and Turkey because of the fear that sunni dominated Kurdish 
      state might work against the Israel-US interest in the region. Such a 
      government might threaten, if not nullify, Turkish control of the 
      waterworks and consequently, of the Tigris and Euphrates. Israel-US also 
      is not feeling very comfortable with the current Turkish Government of 
      Tayep Erdogan which is basically committed to protect Muslim interests. 
      Israel is now apprehending that its hope to get water from mainland Turkey 
      through pipeline might not materialize as long as the current political 
      leadership is in power in Turkey. &nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">UN, about&nbsp; five years 
      back, warned that the countries of the Middle East must find out 
      alternative source of water by 2025 or face complete resource exhaustion 
      and irreversible drought. Political analysts and geo-military strategists 
      believe that if Israel fails to get water from such sources as Nile of 
      Egypt or from Tigris-Euphrates Rivers of Turkey-Iraq, she (Israel) will 
      impose war in the region to have direct access on the water sources. This 
      will also materialize the Zionist dream of “Greater Israel” with the 
      borders of the ancient Kingdom of Judea. Some analysts believe that the 
      objective of the US occupation of Iraq is not only to control oil but also 
      to control water of the region. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">The only 
      thing that can exclude the possibility of war in the West Asia is 
      cooperation among the countries of the region with Israel for sharing 
      water of the region which is a distant possibility keeping in view the 
      attitude of the Israeli leadership towards the Palestinians and Israel’s 
      reluctance to implement the UN resolutions that demands evacuation of all 
      territories occupied Six Day War in 1967 &nbsp;including Golan Heights, the 
      rights of the Palestinian &nbsp;refugees to return to their homeland and 
      recognition of Palestine as a sovereign state with Jerusalem as its 
      capital. The chance of war in the Middle East is likely to diminish if 
      Israel can invent cheap technology for desalination of sea water for use 
      and consumption.</span></td>
