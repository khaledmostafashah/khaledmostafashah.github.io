      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The boycott of American
      and Israeli goods and products is gaining momentum, especially in the
      Middle East, although most Arab regimes have not officially endorsed it.
      The movement is spreading rapidly, with individuals and groups taking the
      campaign to new areas, largely through the internet. In Saudi Arabia
      individuals, groups, businessmen, khatibs at mosques and even school and
      university teachers are supporting a campaign that is helping ordinary
      people to feel empowered for the first time. Unlike the campaign against
      apartheid in South Africa in the seventies and eighties, which had the
      backing of the United Nations, the current anti-Israeli campaign is
      entirely driven by individuals.<o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">High-visibility American
      food-chains are hardest hit. Branch managers of McDonald’s and Kentucky
      Fried Chicken in Egypt have admitted that sales have fallen between 20 and
      50 percent since the beginning of the second intifada, 22 months ago.
      Similar losses have been reported from Saudi Arabia, which imports US $ 6
      billion worth of goods from US each year, compared to US $ 3.7 billion for
      Egypt. With consumers and pro-boycott groups placing advertisements in
      newspapers and posting messages on the internet, the boycott campaign has
      developed teeth, and beginning to bite.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">In Bahrain, when one
      supermarket chain announced that it was taking nearly one million
      dollars’ worth of American goods off its shelves, its sales shot up by
      60 percent: consumers flocked to its stores to shop there in appreciation.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Other American goods that
      have suffered are such brand-name products as Coke, Pepsi, Levi jeans and
      Starbuck. American-manufactured Marlboro cigarettes are also being
      abandoned, with smokers switching to French or local brands. Owners of
      American franchises are trying desperately to win back customers with such
      gimmicks as offering to donate 20 percent of their profits to support
      Palestinian orphans, but consumers are not falling for cheap moves like
      that.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Others have placed
      advertisements in newspapers and on television saying that the boycott is
      hurting local workers. The people are however not influenced by such
      advertisements and are prepared to make more sacrifices. The truth is that
      the boycott campaign is hurting the pockets of pro-American and
      pro-Israeli businessmen.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">In May 2002 delegates from
      19 Arab countries gathered in Damascus, Syria for a meeting of Arab
      Boycott Bureau. The group which was established by the Arab League in
      1951, overseas the boycott of companies that deal with Israel. The meeting
      was the second held since 1993, when it was forced by US pressure to end
      the boycott of pro-Israeli companies after the signing of Oslo Accords.
      That the Accords were a fraud perpetrated against the Palestinian people
      has now become apparent to all.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Egypt, Jordan and
      Mauritania, which have diplomatic relations with Israel, stayed away from
      the Damascus meeting. The government of Hosni Mubarak, while permitting
      boycott of US and Israeli goods, has refused to take part officially.
      However, the Egyptian people remain among the most ardent supporters of
      the boycott campaign, with protest rallies being held at the university
      campuses almost daily. Kentucky Fried Chicken was the target of the
      protesters at Cairo University. They torched one of its outlets, reports
      Crescent International, Canada.<o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">New York Times reported
      that Saudi nationals, enraged by Washington’s Middle East policies, are
      boycotting US goods that have led to a sharp fall of US exports to Saudi
      Arabia. Official US figures show exports plunged 33 percent to US $ 2.8
      billion between September 2001 and March 2002. In the first quarter of
      2002, exports fell 43 percent to US $ 986 million from US $ 1.74 billion a
      year earlier. Many Saudi consumers have shifted to European and Japanese
      products encouraged by campaigners wearing Palestinian checkered
      headscarves who have distributed leaflets at mosques, schools and shopping
      malls. The boycott items include US made household products, vehicles,
      food, beverage, fast-food restaurants and tobacco in protest against
      Washington’s pro-Israel bias and anti-Saudi campaign by some US senators
      and media. Two-way trade estimated at US $ 20 billion. Saudi exports to US
      also fell 36 percent to US $ 2.44 billion during the first quarter
      year-on-year from US $ 3.83 billion. US Embassy commercial officer in
      Riyadh Charley Kestenbaum believes that there would not be much fall in US
      exports to the Kingdom since there is no official boycott and the boycott
      is only at the popular level. Kestenbaum expects that total US exports to
      Saudi Arabia to shrink by about 20 percent in 2002 from US $ 5.97 billion
      in 2001 when they fell by six percent drop from the year before.<o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">US exports to Saudi Arabia
      in first half of 2002 plunged to a 12 year low, reported prestigious Saudi
      daily Arab News. The value of exports reached to US $ 2.2 billion on June
      30, a drop of 30.5 percent in the same period in 2001, the Foreign Trade
      Division of the US Census Bureau said in figure released on the Internet.
      The figure is the lowest for US exports to Saudi Arabia since 1990- when
      Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait, which led to the 1991 Gulf War. Then,
      first-half exports reached only US $ 1.7 billion. It is also less than
      half of an all time high US $ 5 billion in a half year recorded in 1998.
      Saudi exports to the US also dropped 24.2 percent to US $ 5.6 billion in
      the first half from US $ 7.4 billion a year earlier. The value of Saudi
      exports to US reached US $ 13.3 billion last year, of which US $ 12.6
      billion, or 95 percent, were oil and gas related products. The drop in US
      exports to Saudi Arabia is attributed mainly to a 39 percent decline in
      exports of machinery and equipment from US $ 2.1 billion in the first half
      of 2001 to US $ 1.28 billion. Exports of beverage and tobacco plunged by
      55 percent to just US $ 59.6 million from US $ 132.5 million.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">A grass root campaign to
      boycott US products in Saudi Arabia was launched in April following a
      Washington backed Israeli military offensive against Palestinians. The
      campaign was conducted from mosques, schools and universities, and through
      newspapers, the Internet and mobile phone text message urging consumers to
      shun products originating from United States, reports Arab News. Saudi
      Arabia has been the US main trading partner in the Middle East, with US
      civilian and military exports valued at US $ 6.2 billion and imports at US
      $ 14.2 billion in 2000, according to official figures.<o:p>

      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Few would doubt there are
      more who hate America today than a year ago. On the walls of buildings in
      Cairo, posters angrily declare, “American commodities are Israeli
      bullets”. Another chides, “Buy McDonalds’s and kill a
      Palestinian”, reports The Boston Globe, New England.<o:p>
