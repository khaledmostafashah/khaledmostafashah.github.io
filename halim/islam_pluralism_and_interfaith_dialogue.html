    <td width="100%"> <p style="text-align:justify">In the recent past several 
        seminars were organized in the country on interfaith dialogue. These seminars 
        made great contribution in strengthening already existing communal harmony 
        and exposing the hollowness of the propaganda of the interested quarter 
        to malign and defame Bangladesh. These seminars however failed to address 
        the key issues of misperception of the Muslims and non-Muslim alike. Here 
        in this article I shall make an attempt to address some of the texts which 
        hitherto have been misunderstood. </p>
      <p>No doubt Islam stands for pluralistic order. Pluralism is the design 
        of Allah. Al Quran states: If it had been your Lord&#8217;s will, they 
        would all have believed, all who are on the earth. Will you then compel 
        mankind against their will to believe [10:99]? In another verse Al Quran 
        states: To each among you have We prescribed a law and a clear way. If 
        Allah had so willed, He would have made you a single people, but His plan 
        is to test you in what He has given you; so strive as in a race in good 
        deeds [5:48]. </p>
      <p>An examination of the texts of these two verses makes it clear that diversity 
        is the will of Allah. The text of the aforementioned verses also makes 
        it clear that compulsion in the matter of faith is forbidden which is 
        also corroborated by another verse of the Quran which states: Let there 
        be no compulsion in religion [2:256]. </p>
      <p>A critical look of the text of the verse 5:48 manifests that the purpose 
        of these differences is to test, what we do with the revelations and how 
        we behave with the precepts and teachings of Islam and who strive as in 
        a race in good deeds. Diversity of religions, nations and peoples is a 
        test and the teachings of Islam require that we manage the differences 
        and live a peaceful harmonious life in this world. This is pluralism. 
      </p>
      <p>Al Quran states: And did not Allah check one set of people by means of 
        another, the earth would indeed be full of mischief [2:251]. In another 
        verse Al Quran states: Did not Allah check one set of people by means 
        of another, monasteries, churches, synagogues and mosques wherein the 
        name of Allah is mentioned much would surely have been pulled down [22:40]. 
      </p>
      <p>The teaching of the aforementioned two verses is very significant in 
        the present world context. The ever lasting teachings, the universal dimension 
        of the message of Islam of these two verses are that if there are no differences 
        between people, if power is concentrated in the hands of one group alone, 
        be it one nation or one race the earth would be corrupt because human 
        beings require others to control and limit their irresponsible impulse 
        and behavior for expansion, supremacy and dominance. Verse 22:40 indicates 
        that the scheme of Allah is to protect monasteries, churches, synagogues 
        and mosques which establishes pluralistic religious nature of Islam. </p>
      <p>Islam is basically a tolerant religion. The difference between peoples, 
        nations, races and religions may lead to conflict and therefore mans&#8217; 
        responsibility remains in establishing peace and tranquility in the society. 
        It is important that a balance is established in the society based on 
        mutual respect, love and compassion rejecting all types of arrogance, 
        whether it is material or intellectual and establishing such balance between 
        different nations and communities is possible only by sharing knowledge 
        about each other. Al Quran states: O mankind, We created you from a single 
        pair of a male and a female and made you into nations and tribes that 
        you may know each other [49:13]. Knowing and respecting each other and 
        dialogue and communication is the best way to avoid mistrust and overcome 
        differences. </p>
      <p>Establishing harmonious relations between peoples have been repeatedly 
        emphasized in Islam. Al Quran states: Allah forbids you not with regard 
        to those who fight you not for your faith nor drive you out of your homes 
        from dealing kindly and justly with them for Allah loves those who are 
        just [60:8]. In another verse Al Quran states: Invite all to the way of 
        your Lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching and argue with them in ways 
        that are best and most gracious [16:125]. In another verse Al Quran states: 
        And dispute you not with the People of the Book except in the best way, 
        unless it be with those of them who do wrong [29:46]. </p>
      <p>Confusion also exists among scholars and general people alike as to the 
        meaning of the words Kafir, Kuffar, Kafara, Kafaru, Yakfuru which are 
        commonly misunderstood both by Muslims and non-Muslims alike as being 
        disbeliever, infidels or miscreants. But the word has also been used in 
        the Quran in the sense of deny, deniers, denial, denied. Verse 3:28 states: 
        Let the believers (Muslims) not take as allies the deniers (Kafirin) rather 
        than believers. Arabic notion of Kufr or Kafir has often been mistranslated. 
        Etymologically the general meaning of Kafir could be rendered as a denier 
        with a veiled heart, veiled, shut off in their hearts to the extent that 
        they deny the presence of the Creator. The dictionary meaning of Kufr 
        also includes hide and cover up.</p>
      <p>But Kafir may also indicate one who denies the evidence of the truth 
        as is apparent in the revelation. Iblis knew the existence of Allah as 
        he spoke to Him, but he refused to obey. Al Quran states: He (Iblis) refused, 
        became proud and was among the deniers (min al kafirin) [2:34]. It would 
        be pointless to say that Iblis, who had a dialogue Allah Subhanahu Wa 
        &#8216;Taala, did not believe in Him. This is neither logical nor a consistent 
        translation. </p>
      <p>So to apply the term Kafir to Jews and Christians is justified as they 
        do not recognize the Quran as the last revealed book. They deny (Yakfuru) 
        the truth of the message and its Prophet, but this does not mean we call 
        them miscreants in the sense that their faith in God is not recognized, 
        which would be an inaccurate assertion [Tariq Ramadan (Professor of Philosophy 
        at the College of Geneva and Professor of Islamic Studies at the University 
        of Fribourg, Switzerland), Western Muslims and the Future of Islam, Oxford 
        University Press, New York, 2004, pp 206]. </p>
      <p>Dr. Muhammad Iqbal, the greatest poet-philosopher of Islam, affirmed 
        that Hindus could not be considered as kafirs as they believe in the supremacy 
        of God [Dr. Muhammad Iqbal, Gayatri Mantra, Urdu tr., Introduction quoted 
        in Rafiq Zakaria&#8217;s Indian Muslims Where have they gone wrong?, Popular 
        Prakashan and Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai, September 2004, p 246].</p>
      <p>It is apparent that these scholars do not feel it appropriate to call 
        Jews, Christians, Hindus etc. as Kafirs because they do not deny the existence 
        Almighty God. They are of course non-Muslims.</p>
      <p>The pluralistic nature of Islam is evident from the fact that the duty 
        of a Muslim is only educating and passing the knowledge of Islam, near 
        and far. Al Quran states: And admonish your nearest kinsmen [26: 214]. 
        The responsibility ends with educating, transmitting and communicating 
        faith. To pass on the message is to call and invite people to the way 
        of Allah. Conversion is something that only Allah can alone accomplish. 
        It is an affair of the heart and does not lie within anyone else&#8217;s 
        purview and jurisdiction. It is only the prerogative of Allah. This is 
        the real meaning of Litakunu Shuhadaa Ala Al Nass- bear witness to the 
        message before mankind. </p>
      <p>The pluralistic nature of Islam is further established by its principle 
        of justice in all circumstances, in relation to Muslims and non-Muslims 
        alike. Al Quran states: O you who believe! Stand out firmly for Allah 
        as witnesses to fair dealing, and let not the hatred of others to you 
        make you swerve to wrong and depart from justice. Be just: that is next 
        to piety: and fear Allah. For Allah is well-acquainted with all that you 
        do [5:8]. The principle of justice in Islam constitutes the fundamental 
        norm after faith in the oneness of Allah (Tawhid). This principle takes 
        precedence over one&#8217;s own interest, the interest of relatives, interest 
        of race, interest of nations and so on. If, for example, Muslims are called 
        to participate in a war that is unjust or based solely on the longing 
        for power, conquer land or control of territory or resources and other 
        interests, they should not take part in such a war. Muslims are not allowed 
        to fight for money, wealth or resources, grab power or occupy territory. 
        They must avoid oppressive war. </p>
      <p>Muslims cannot participate in unjust war, whatever is the identity or 
        religion of the enemy. Belonging to particular faith does not mean that 
        Muslims are required to accept or support injustice simply because it 
        is committed by another member of the same faith. On the contrary, Muslims, 
        according to the teachings of Islam, are required to oppose and even stop 
        such injustice even if it is committed by another Muslim. Prophet Muhammad 
        said: Help your brother whether he is unjust or the victim of injustice. 
        One of the companions asked: Messenger of Allah. I understand helping 
        someone who is the victim of injustice, but how should I help one who 
        is unjust? The Prophet replied: Prevent him from being unjust. That is 
        how you will help him [Bukhari. Muslim]. Another Hadith reports Prophet 
        Muhammad said: Whoever of you sees an evil action, let him change it with 
        his hands; and if he is not able to do so, then with his tongue; and if 
        he is not able to do so, then with his heart- and that is the weakest 
        of faith [Muslim quoted in An-Nawawi&#8217;s Forty Hadith, tr. Ezzedin 
        Ibrahim and Denys Johnson-Davies, Holy Quran Publishing House, Damascus, 
        1977, p110]</p>
      <p>To erase the misgiving from the peoples&#8217; mind another issue that 
        need to be addressed in interfaith dialogue is the truth of the claim 
        of killing of 400 to 900 Jews tribesmen of Banu Qurayza in cold blood 
        and later buried in trenches in Medina by Prophet Muhammad for breaking 
        treaty and joining enemy ranks as related by Ibn Ishaq in Sira, the biography 
        of the Prophet. This narration of Ibn Ishaq, as examined and proved hereunder, 
        is a later innovation and challenged by the scholars. </p>
      <p>Imam Malik, a contemporary of Ibn Ishaq, denounced Ibn Ishaq as an outright 
        liar [Uyun al-Athar, 1, 2] and imposter [ibid, 1, 16] for transmitting 
        such stories. Tabari, nearly 150 years after Ibn Ishaq, doubted that Prophet 
        dig trenches. Ibn al-Qayyin in Zad al-Ma&#8217;ad ignores altogether the 
        crucial question of numbers killed. Ibn Kathir even seems to have general 
        doubt in his mind about the narration of Ibn Ishaq [Tabari, Tarikh, 1, 
        1499 (where the reference is to al-Waqidi, Maghazi, 11, 513); Zad al-Maad 
        (ed. T. A. Taha, Cairo, 1970), 11, 82; Ibn Kathir, IV, 118]. The attitude 
        of scholars and historians to Ibn Ishaq&#8217;s version of the story has 
        been either one of complacency, sometimes mingled with uncertainty, or 
        at least in two important cases, one of condemnation and outright rejection. 
      </p>
      <p>One of the weakness of the authors of Sira including Ibn Ishaq is that, 
        unlike the compiler of Hadith who applied critical criteria for checking 
        accuracy of the Hadith, they are not meticulous and did not apply the 
        strict rules of traditions, did not provide chain of authorities, did 
        not verify whether the narrators are trustworthy or not and therefore 
        Sira cannot be really taken as absolutely authentic. </p>
      <p>The reference of the Quran to this incidence is also very brief: Some 
        you killed, some you took prisoner [33:26]. Scholars are of opinion that 
        the reference of Quran as to the killing can only be those who were actually 
        killed in the fighting. </p>
      <p>The truth of killing of 400 to 900 Jews tribesmen of Banu Qurayza by 
        the Prophet is rejected by scholars as Islam permits punishing only those 
        who are responsible for sedition. To kill such a large number is also 
        opposed to the Islamic sense of justice Al Quran states: No soul shall 
        bear another&#8217;s burden [35:18]. It is also against the Quranic injunction 
        regarding the prisoner of war. Verse 47:4 states that when the enemy is 
        brought under control, the prisoners are to be treated with generosity 
        (i.e. release the prisoner to freedom without ransom) or ransom is recommended.</p>
      <p>Moreover it is unlikely that Banu Qurayza should be slaughtered when 
        other Jewish groups who surrendered before Banu Qurayza and after them 
        were treated leniently and allowed them to go. Indeed Abu Ubayd b.Sallam 
        relates in his Kitab al-Amwal that when Khaybar fall to the Muslims there 
        were among the residents a particular family or clan who had distinguished 
        themselves by excessive rude abuse of the Prophet. Yet the Prophet addressed 
        them in words which are no more than a rebuke [ed. Khalil Muhammad Harras, 
        Cairo, 1388/1968, 241]. This happened after the surrender of Banu Qurayza. 
        If so many hundreds of people had actually been put to death in the market-place 
        of Medina and trenches were dug for the burial, it is strange that there 
        is no trace whatsoever of all that &#8211; no sign, no visible mark to 
        point to the place of massacre or burial trenches.</p>
      <p>Had this slaughter actually happened jurists would have adopted it as 
        a precedent? In fact exactly the opposite has been the case. The attitude 
        of jurists and their rulings have been more according to the precepts 
        of Islam. Al Quran states: No soul shall bear another&#8217;s burden [35:18]. 
      </p>
      <p>Indeed Abu Ubayd b. Sallam relates a very significant incident in his 
        book Kitab al-Amwal which is a book of jurisprudence, not of Sira (biography). 
        He narrated an event of trouble among a group of the People of the Book 
        (Ahal al Kitab) in Lebanon when Abdullah b. Ali was the regional governor. 
        The governor put down the sedition and ordered the community in question 
        to be moved to elsewhere. Imam al-Awzai, contemporary of Ibn Ishaq, in 
        has capacity as the leading jurist of the time immediately objected to 
        this decision of the governor. His argument was that the episode was not 
        the result of the community&#8217;s unanimous agreement. He argued that 
        under Islamic Shariah many people cannot be punished for the fault of 
        the few. Islamic Shariah on the contrary stipulates the punishment of 
        the few for the fault of the many. If Imam al-Awzai had accepted the story 
        of slaughter of Banu Qurayza as related by Ibn Ishaq as true he would 
        have treated it as a precedent and would not have come out with an argument 
        against authority represented by governor Abdullah b. Ali and would have 
        advised the governor to act according to precedent of Banu Qurayza. <br>
        <br>
        The later scholar after scrutiny agreed that it would be reasonable to 
        conclude that a few specific persons of Banu Qurayza tribe as having been 
        put to death, some of whom were described as active in their hostility 
        and were the ones who led the sedition and who were consequently punished 
        &#8211; not the whole tribe. </p>
      <p>The sources of the story of the killing of Banu Qurayza as related by 
        Ibn Ishaq are extremely doubtful and the details are utterly opposed to 
        the spirit of Islam and the rules of the Quran. Credible authority is 
        lacking and circumstantial evidence does not corroborate and support it. 
        This means that the story is doubtful. In fact Ibn Ishaq quoted as source 
        such persons who were already dead at the time of occurrence of the incident.</p>
      <p>The story of killing of Jews in Medina according to some other scholars 
        and historians however has origin in earlier events. Prof. Guillaume is 
        of the opinion that Jews arrived in Medina after Jewish Wars [A. Guillaume, 
        Islam (Harmondsworth, 1956), 10-11]. According to Flavius Josephus, himself 
        a Jew, Alexander, who ruled in Jerusalem before Herod the Great, hung 
        upon crosses 800 Jewish captives and slaughtered their wives and children 
        before their eyes [De bello Judaico, 1, 4, 6]. At Masada the number of 
        those who died at the end was 960 [ibd, VII, 9, 1]. </p>
      <p>Clearly the similarity of the numbers killed is most striking. This is 
        indeed more than a mere resemblance. The origin of the story of Banu Qurayza, 
        preserved by descendants of Jews who fled south of Arabia after the Jewish 
        Wars, just as Flavius Josephus recorded the same story for the Classical 
        world. A later generation of their descendants superimposed details of 
        the siege of Masada on the story of the siege of Banu Qurayza, perhaps 
        by confusing a tradition of their distant past with one from their less 
        remote history. The mixture provide Ibn Ishaq&#8217;s story. </p>
      <p>Thus Muslims and non-Muslims alike must make sincere efforts to be acquainted 
        with the true teachings of Islam and authentic history of Muslim culture 
        and civilization for that can ensure peace and tranquility in this conflict 
        ridden world. This is also important as that can alone change the western 
        mindset which is vital to bring an end of hegemony and unilateralism.
