      political movement must pause from time to time to look critically at
      itself and to assess its performances in order to be able to map its own
      future course. But in Bangladesh this is not really the practice. The
      political culture of Bangladesh is such that the country’s leadership
      never publicly admits their mistakes. This is by and large true of all
      political parties more so of the key players in the political arena- the
      Bangladesh Awami League (AL), Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP),
      Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh (JI) and Jatiya Party (JP)<o:p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Unfortunately, AL
      until now did not admit that it committed in 1975 a gross mistake by
      imposing one party BAKSAL rule in the country and by gagging the press. AL
      even today tries to justify this action on different alibi. Sheikh Mujibur
      Rahman is being criticized for inducting government servants, both civil
      and military, as members of BAKSAL. Today’s situation is still worse for
      every political party that was in power in Bangladesh in the recent past
      has created vested interest groups particularly among the civil
      bureaucracy by giving undue promotion and posting and interfering the
      recruiting process and thereby politicizing the administration. It is
      alleged that one particular political party is giving membership to the
      government servants, even to the civil bureaucracy. <u><o:p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Immediately after
      the independence of Bangladesh, leftwing Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (JSD)
      acted foolishly and attacked the residence of the then Home Minister Capt.
      Monsur Ali in violation of the country’s law for which Police had to
      fire on the attackers, as a result of which several persons got killed.
      But JSD is yet to admit that it was an unwise decision. JSD stirred
      rebellion in the army with the help and support of several retired army
      officers for which these army officers were later tried under court
      martial and hanged. JSD until now did not confess that it was wrong on its
      part, being a political party, to use army for political purposes and
      encourage sedition in the army.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;

      <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">JI is yet to
      publicly admit that its collaboration with the Pakistan army in 1971 was
      both morally and legally wrong. It was morally wrong on the part of JI to
      support the army when it was killing innocent civilians<sup>1</sup>, more
      so when it claims itself to be the torchbearer of Islam. Supporting the
      Pakistan army was legally wrong, for the Majlish-e-Shoora of
      Jamaat-e-Islami East Pakistan decided to support the independence of East
      Pakistan from the western wing of the country, the then West Pakistan,
      even before the crack down by the Pakistan army on the night of 25th
      March, and hoisted the flag of Bangladesh in its office at Kausar House as
      mark of its support to the freedom and independence of Bangladesh.
      Earlier, the Central Majlish-e-Shoora of Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan
      authorized the Provincial Majlish-e-Shoora of East Pakistan
      Jamaat-e-Islami to take decision whether to remain part of the federation
      of Pakistan or to secede in view of the political development in the
      eastern wing. The resolution inter alia states: “The Majlish-e-Shoora of
      East Pakistan Jamaat reviewed the situation prevailing in the country and <i>favoured
      constitutional separation rather than armed struggle</i>” <sup>2</sup>
      In spite of this resolution, the coterie leadership of JI that was present
      in Dhaka on the night of 25th March reversed this historic decision of the
      East Pakistan Majlish-e-Shoora of Jamaat having no legal authority to do
      that and thereby plunged the whole Party on road to destruction and
      diminished its future political prospect. Political observers opine that
      this the coward JI coterie leadership did out of fear of possible atrocity
      by the Pakistan army over them or because of their link with the
      deep-seated conspiracy of the hawks of the Pakistan army that hitherto
      remained masked.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jamaat also
      until now did not come out with any statement explaining why it earlier
      took decision that it “<i>favoured constitutional separation rather than
      armed struggle</i>” and<i> </i>what prompted it later to reverse this
      historic decision of the Majlish-e-Shoora of East Pakistan Jamaat. <o:p>

      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The 1995-1996
      assessment of JI that situation obtaining in Bangladesh is ripe for its
      political comeback and its decision to nominate 300 candidates in the
      parliamentary election was also not wise. This JI did because the
      organization, again like 1971, became hostage in the hands of relatively
      young coterie leadership and also because of emotional response by its top
      leader Prof. Ghulam Azam to his imprisonment by the ruling BNP government
      failing to realize the would be consequences of his stance. Commenting on
      AL ascending to power in 1996 that greatly harmed Bangladesh national
      interest (which even JI admitted later) because of the JI tooth and nail
      opposition to BNP, the then chief of JI Prof. Azam is on record to have
      said: “it was necessary to bring AL to power in 1996 to let the new
      generation know what is AL” <sup>3</sup><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>This shows that Prof. Azam did not really regret for adopting wrong
      electoral strategy. Indeed Prof. Azam did long term harm to the country by
      supporting the rebellion of the civil bureaucracy in 1996 against the
      constitutional government that hastened the fall of the government of
      Begum Khaleda Zia. Instead of condemning the rebellion of the civil
      servants, he sarcastically remarked: What else the civil servants could
      do?<sup>4</sup><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>JI leadership
      was so charged that the then Assistant Secretary General of JI Ali Ahasan
      Mohammad Mojaheed, now Secretary General of Jamaat and Minister for Social
      Welfare, talking to the journalists of Daily Sangram, the official
      mouthpiece of JI, reiterated his firm determination to bring Sheikh Hasina
      to power even if for a day. However, the JI review paper submitted in the
      U.K. Conference on “Mechanisms for Construction of Joint Political
      Stance” admitted that its 1995-1996 election strategy of “joining
      hands with AL in the movement against BNP government in the mid nineties
      was disliked and disapproved by Jamaat’s electorate” <sup>5</sup> A
      senior attorney of JI privately confined to this writer that JI loss in
      political terms was more in 1996 than in 1971 for more workers left the
      party or became inactive as a result its policy in 1996 than in 1971.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;

      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">BNP is yet to admit
      openly that its decision to isolate JI was politically wrong for it was JI
      that helped it to form government in 1991 by giving unqualified support.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">But whether JI or
      BNP admits their mistake openly or not, they did homework to find out the
      reasons of their political debacle in the 1996 parliamentary election. In
      1996 election JI seats came down to 3 parliamentary seats; whereas, in the
      previous parliament it had as many as 20 members. BNP in 1996 election not
      only had to leave power, its seats in the parliament came down to as low
      as 116. After analyzing the result of 1996 parliamentary election both JI
      and BNP reached the conclusion that it was for their mutual advantage that
      they should form a political alliance to contest the next election (that
      was held in October 2001), particularly because of the cronyism, nepotism,
      misrule, rampant corruption, murder of political opponents and, above all,
      the anarchic political environment created by the government of Sheikh
      Hasina, the AL president and daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. JI became
      fed up with fascist nature of AL governance and politics and “equated it
      with Hitler’s Nazi Party” <sup>6.</sup> <o:p>

      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Commenting on the
      core difference of AL and BNP, a pro-Jamaat professional, not happy with
      JI hobnobbing with AL, said to this writer: “Some people within JI
      leadership do not find any difference between AL and BNP for their lack of
      understanding of the politics of these two parties. Yes, AL is not an
      anti-Islamic Party and its leaders offer five times prayer. But when AL is
      in power the anti-Islamic activities flourish. On the other hand, BNP is
      not an Islamic Party either, and its leaders do not offer five times
      prayer regularly. But when BNP assumes power grounds are created for
      Islamic work and Islamic culture and environment flourishes. This is the
      difference between AL and BNP” <sup>7</sup>. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The parliamentary
      election of October 2001, in which JI and BNP formed an alliance along
      with like-minded rightist, centrist and Islamic parties, proved beneficial
      both for BNP and JI. BNP emerged in the political scene with absolute
      majority commanding more than two-thirds of the parliamentary seats in a
      parliament of 300 members and JI won in 17 seats; whereas, it had only 3
      members in the previous parliament. After the election, the four-party
      alliance formed government in which the component parties joined. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">After stocktaking
      the result of the October 2001 parliamentary election, JI realized that
      the cause of BNP-Jamaat victory is the alliance. “But for the BNP-Jamaat
      unity, Awami League would have returned to power with a comfortable
      majority. BNP would have lost 75 seats and Awami League would have gained
      the same number in a 300-member parliament. Without alliance, Jamaat may
      not have got 17 seats”, states the JI review paper presented in U.K.
      Conference <sup>8. </sup><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Thus,
      it is obvious that JI realized that its 1995-1996 election strategy was
      wrong though it did not publicly admit it. <o:p>

      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Bangladesh enjoys a
      unique situation because of its geographical location, particularly
      because India has a narrow corridor on northwest of Bangladesh more widely
      known as “chicken corridor” that connects mainland India with its
      eastern flank--the eastern India where she is facing armed uprising for
      freedom. Indeed India is using all diplomatic channels and trying to
      induce Bangladesh to give land corridor to facilitate India’s movement
      of troops across Bangladesh to eastern India. India has an interest in the
      land corridor through Bangladesh for that would facilitate the marketing
      of its products to eastern India. India has an interest in this corridor
      for in case of an Indo-China war in the Nefa front, India would require
      land corridor through Bangladesh for immediate movement of troops and
      supplies. India has also interest in Bangladesh natural resources,
      particularly gas. Some analysts say that Pakistan also uses Bangladesh as
      a launching pad to make trouble in eastern Indian states to compel her to
      deploy substantial troops in the eastern front and keep India busy to
      contain insurgency and thereby force India to reduce the deployment of
      troops in the western front with Pakistan and ease pressure. Bangladesh
      denounces such baseless allegations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;

      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">This being geo-political
      situation, India very much wants to see a friendly government in
      Bangladesh, and who is friendlier to India in Bangladesh than Awami
      League, which reportedly maintains warm relations with India. AL relations
      with India were consolidated during 50s and 60s and during the Indian
      involvement with the freedom movement of Bangladesh. This relation was
      further strengthened when Sheikh Hasina came to power in 1996.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The people of
      Bangladesh became suspicious of AL, which, after forming government in
      1996 after more than two decades, took such steps that exposed nakedly its
      subservient attitude towards India. Sheikh Hasina even did not take it
      into cognizance, nor she protested, when she was described as chief
      minister at a function in India. This enraged the people of Bangladesh who
      earned their independence after so much sacrifice of lives. AL government
      also took such steps that hurt the sentiments of the common Muslims and
      alienated the Muslims voters. The <i>ulama</i> chiefly became unhappy over
      the AL government because of the cut down of grant to the <i>madrasha</i>
      (religious school). The people were highly critical of Police overdoing in
      the national mosque Baitul Mukarram, particularly Police entering the
      mosque with their boots on to arrest political opponents that took
      sanctuary within the mosque premise to evade arrest. At this time, six
      persons got killed in Brahmanbaria because of Police firing on the
      peaceful procession of the <i>ulama </i>who were demonstrating against the
      court verdict to curtail their right to issue <i>fatwa</i>. The <i>ulama</i>
      became furious at being the target of AL government vengeance when they
      were arrested and tortured for every bomb blast in the country, notably
      the Ramna Botomul, Udichi Jessore, Narayangonj and Kotlipara. The <i>ulama</i>
      also disliked pro-government media playing caricature with beard and cap,
      the symbol of Muslim identity that is highly regarded in the society. The
      hatred of the <i>ulama</i> against the government of Sheikh Hasina reached
      its climax when Police arrested the <i>imam</i> of a mosque in Muhammadpur,
      Dhaka when a dead body was found inside the mosque, which others thought
      to be a conspiracy of the government to discredit the mosque <i>imams</i>,
      who are largely anti-Awami League, and termed it as an AL attempt to
      tarnish the good image of the Islamic religious scholars in the country.
      People largely believe that the Awami agents kept the dead body inside the
      mosque to create uproar in the country against the Islamic elements. In
      this backdrop, the rightwing centrist, nationalist and Islamic forces
      united into a common political platform on 30<sup>th</sup> November 1999
      that ultimately defeated AL government by an overwhelming majority.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span><o:p>

      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Political analysts
      believe that it is important that the present alliance between the
      nationalist and Islamic forces is maintained, for any setback of the
      alliance will bring AL to power which is thoroughly secular and widely
      suspected for its link with India. The results of the last several
      parliamentary elections depicts that the nationalist BNP and ultra secular
      AL have almost equal voting strength. JI commands approximately 9 percent
      votes, and other small Islamic parties put together have one percent
      votes. Any swing of these 10 percent pro-Islamic votes largely affects the
      formation of the government. This has been amply proved both by the
      election results of 1991 and 1996. It is both for the interest of the
      country in general, and JI and BNP in particular, that they maintain their
      unity, political observers opine. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The most
      significant outcome of the alliance in the political arena is that it has
      been able to isolate students from national politics. It was Chattra
      Shibir and Chattra Dal strife that created rift between JI and BNP in the
      aftermath of the parliamentary election in 1991. This time both JI and BNP
      have taken lesson from the past mistakes and are now controlling
      respective student organizations with iron hand precluding the possibility
      to make national politics hostage at the hands of the students.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">It is important to
      evaluate how BNP is benefited by forming the alliance with JI and the
      like-minded parties apart from the fact that BNP got the votes of the
      alliance partners in those constituencies where JI and other partners of
      the alliance did not nominate candidates which helped BNP achieve
      landslide victory and form government. The most noteworthy advantage that
      BNP got out of this alliance is that huge number of dedicated workers of
      JI participated in the campaign for BNP candidates. This writer has direct
      knowledge of Jamaat’s women workers campaigning door to door in the
      Dhaka city that undoubtedly helped BNP candidates to have an edge over AL
      candidates and achieve, sometimes, easy victory. A large number of elected
      BNP MPs also acknowledge this fact.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
      </o:p>
      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The image of the
      BNP increased tremendously among the patriotic forces and anti-Indian
      electorates because of its alliance with JI and like mined parties. It
      also increased the image of the BNP among the Muslim countries,
      particularly among the countries of the West Asia. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Now the question
      is, is the alliance beneficial for the onward march and advancement of the
      Islamic movement? Is alliance government helpful to push the Islamic
      agenda or obstacle to the stride and progress of <i>dawah</i>. This needs
      to be addressed dispassionately. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">It however needs to
      be critically examined and analyzed the benefits that the Islamic parties
      are deriving from the alliance with semi-secular centrist rightwing party.
      What are the demerits of such power-sharing, if any, and what are the
      possible formidable obstacles which Islamic parties might face in future
      because of such half-hearted unity, for such alliance is a marriage of
      convenience and politics of expediency and not to pursue common
      ideological goal and objective. One thing clear is that although such
      alliance does not usher in the process of Islamization, the negative trend
      of de-Islamization and its speed has certainly become slow, if not
      reversed, nonetheless, it is also true that Islamic parties in the long
      run cannot hope to cope with the secular leadership without postponing or
      delaying the implementation of some of the principled issues. It seems,
      Jamaat wants to take such a situation with good grace till such time the
      people are ready for total Islamic transformation. In this connection
      Jamaat frequently quotes the saying of Imam Hasan al Banna to justify its
      political stand. He said: “Let us help one another in all matters on
      which we agree, and let us excuse one another where we differ”. JI
      thinks in the long run the experience of such alliance might prepare the
      ground for social change, and joining the alliance government might appear
      as participation in the training school for good governance. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The history or the
      experience of forming alliance, unlike neighboring India, is new in
      Bangladesh. This culture of power sharing is yet to take its firm roots in
      Bangladesh that has been reflected in the recent reshuffle of the cabinet.
      Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia, without prior consultation with the
      partners of the alliance, reallocated the Ministry of Industries to JI
      chief Moulana Motiur Rahman Nizami that caused commotion among the rank
      and file of JI. Moulna Nizami felt so much embarrassed, shocked and
      humiliated over the reallocation of the Ministry without prior
      consultation that he expressed his desire to leave the Ministry at a
      meeting of the Majlish-e-Amela, the Central Executive Committee, of the
      Jamaat. Jamaat Majlish-e-Amela, after detailed deliberations, however,
      advised Mulana Nizami to continue his ministerial role. Analysts opine
      that Moulana Nizami was transferred from the Ministry of Agriculture for
      some of the BNP leaders felt allergic about his good performances, while
      others felt unhappy over the horizontal expansion of JI at the grass root
      level that Moulana Nizami could muster because of his opportunity to
      frequently visit different areas of the country, which he had to do for
      the good performance of the Ministry of Agriculture.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Another interesting
      recent development is that as soon as Moulana Nizami took over the charges
      of the Ministry of Industry, the government could easily get approval of
      the two DAP (Die Ammonium Phosphate) projects, one Japanese and one
      Chinese, to be executed in Chittagong under supplier’s credit and
      buyer’s credit that would involve Bangladesh Taka 3.92 billion and Taka
      4.51 billion through Economic Affairs Committee. Earlier, M. K. Anwar, the
      then Minister for Industry, himself a trained civil servant, was objecting
      the implementation the two projects for evaluation reports suggested that
      the two projects, if implemented, would incur a loss of approximately
      Taka1.00 billion annually. To create the justification for approving the
      two projects, the government conducted fresh evaluation of the two
      projects. Informed sources say that Moulana Nizami could do little to
      forestall the implementation of the projects as sons of two powerful
      Ministers of the government are alleged to be the local agents of the two
      projects. Moulana Nizami in an interview with the daily New Nation on 6<sup>th</sup>
      September 2003 however justified the implementation of the two projects
      for what he said “in the interest of the nation”<sup>9</sup> although
      the interim Caretaker Government in 2001 “postponed the work”<sup>10</sup>
      of the projects<sup>.<o:p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Moreover, there is a
      belief in a section of Jamaat that it is not getting the fair treatment it
      deserves from BNP. While formulating committees at different levels of the
      administration, the representatives of Jamaat are inducted in such
      committees that are not important. JI leaders at the grass root level view
      it as an attempt by the BNP to contain Jamaat. A noticeable example of the
      BNP’s attempt to contain Jamaat is that whenever Prime Minister Begum
      Khaleda Zia addresses the nation over radio and television in national
      hook-up on special occasions to highlight the performances of the
      government she calculatedly avoids to mention the performance of the
      ministries which are headed by Jamaat chief Moulana Motiur Rahman Nizami
      and Secretary General Ali Ahasan Mohammad Mojaheed. It seems Begum Zia
      deliberately avoided mentioning the performance of Moulana Nizami both as
      Minister for Agriculture and Minister for Industries. JI has a feeling,
      which is also shared by the other component parties of the alliance, that
      major issues should be discussed in the alliance meeting before raising
      such issues in the cabinet meeting. Alliance partners including JI feel
      dismay that the issues like whether to give transit facilities to India,
      exporting gas to India, withdrawal of water by the India in the upper
      riparian of the rivers, ethnic conflict in the Hill Tracts etc. have not
      been raised in the alliance meeting by the Prime Minister Begum Khaleda
      Zia, Chairperson of BNP, the major partner of the alliance. Jamaat has a
      feeling that unless it is able to implement one or two Islamic agendas, as
      for example, the banning of prostitution, it might be difficult for it to
      face its electorate and its participation in the alliance ultimately might
      turn out to be negative for it. Jamaat believes that this cannot be done
      unless the committees of the alliance take a full structure and its
      meetings are held regularly and major issues affecting the future prospect
      of the alliance are discussed in such meeting. The small partners of the
      alliance have a feeling that they are being ignored and the alliance is a
      unity between the unequal. The Islamic parties in the alliance now think
      that it was wrong not to bargain in the initial stage during the formative
      stage of the alliance with BNP and give unqualified support. JI has also a
      feeling that representatives from the other partners of the alliance
      should have been inducted in the cabinet considering its size. Jamaat is
      apprehending that the exclusion of the Islamic Oikkya Jote leaders from
      the government might harm the unity of the alliance in the long run. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">An additional
      difficulty that the JI is facing is that, being the part of government; it
      is not in a position to openly express its dissatisfaction over BNP
      activities. Only recently (2<sup>nd</sup> August 2003) Jamaat MP Dr.
      Abdullah Muhammad Taher was reportedly attacked at Narayangonj by
      extortionist allegedly belonging to pro-BNP Chattra Dal. Dr. Taher refused
      to oblige the extortionist, in retaliation, the extortionist fired at him.
      Dr. Taher narrowly escaped, although two of his companies got injured in
      the incident. The national press reported the incident. Dr. Taher,
      however, was neither allowed to hold a press conference on this issue by
      the JI as it would discredit BNP, the major partner of the alliance, nor
      did JI itself publicly protest the attempt on the life of its MP, although
      government took stern action. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Even JI could not
      make protest when in the budget for 2003-2004 provision was kept to reduce
      the rate of duty, to the great embarrassment of JI, on alcoholic drinks;
      whereas, the rate of duty on such items as salt was enhanced. The duty on
      alcohol was, however, re-imposed the same day it was reduced. The Islamic
      parties of the alliance have a feeling that they have no control over the
      government. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Another hurdle,
      which the alliance might face in future, is the sharing of seats among the
      partners of the alliance in forthcoming parliamentary election to be held
      in 2006. Some analysts are of the opinion that in the upcoming
      parliamentary election JI might demand more parliamentary seats, and the
      scenario might be such that JI might contest in as many as 10-15 open
      constituencies with BNP still remaining a partner of the alliance. During
      the 1996 parliamentary election both BNP and JI candidates contested in a
      parliamentary constituency in Chittagong, although both the parties were
      partners in the alliance. <o:p>

      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Having said this,
      it needs to be studied objectively the merits of such power sharing by
      parties like JI that still claims to be working for an Islamic
      renaissance.<o:p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText2"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">With the slur of
      having opposed the creation of independent and sovereign Bangladesh and
      its collaboration with Pakistan army to defend the unity of Pakistan,
      particularly when its workers took up arms to resist the Mukti Bahini,
      Bangladesh freedom fighters, armed by the Indo-Soviet axis, JI was not in
      a very comfortable situation after the birth of the new nation for its
      “negative role” <sup>11</sup> in the liberation movement. The party
      ceased its open activities immediately after the liberation. In such a
      backdrop, it is no mean achievement that JI is in power in Bangladesh. The
      participation of JI in the elected government is a significant development
      in Bangladesh politics. By joining the government JI has, in fact, entered
      the mainstream politics. Jamaat thinks that joining the government was
      important to establish that it is a patriotic political force and has the
      right to govern Bangladesh. By joining the government, JI has been able to
      erase much misgivings about it which the result of mal propaganda by
      pro-Indian quarters that if JI comes to power it will conspire to make
      Bangladesh part of Pakistan. Now that JI is in the government, such
      negative propaganda will not work in future. In the days ahead, it would
      be difficult to brand JI as an “anti-liberation force”.<o:p>

      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The most notable
      achievement of joining the alliance government is that JI leadership is
      realizing what is the corridor of power, how modern statecraft operates
      and what is hegemony. How World Bank, IMF, United States and other major
      powers of the West force Third World counties to toe to their line in the
      name of aid, grant, etc. How India creates instability in Bangladesh and
      how India floods Bangladesh market by dumping goods, etc. The forward
      looking leaders within the Jamaat thinks that experience in the government
      will hopefully give its leadership the necessary vision to make changes
      within and make its policy pragmatic and bring it closer to reality, and
      modify the compulsory reading materials, what it calls course curriculum,
      for its manpower to enlighten its workforce on the hard realities of
      modern life and political process.<o:p>

      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">In the post
      September 11 scenario, the fact that JI is in the alliance government, the
      United States could not make it a target branding it a fundamentalist
      force and US attempt to link JI with Taliabn and Al Qaeda did not succeed.
      Had JI not been in the government, definitely it would become the victim
      of Western wrath and vengeance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>

      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">By joining the
      government, JI has been able to erase some of the misgiving about it in
      the West; as for example; JI is opposed to women leadership and does not
      believe in equality between men and women.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Now that JI is a
      partner in the government, the major partner being a secular democratic
      force, it has become easy for JI to prove that it is not a militant force
      and does believe in the change of government through peaceful, democratic
      and constitutional means.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
      </o:p>
      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The JI ministers
      are seen visiting the Hindu <i>mandop</i> (platform to offer worship to a
      deity) during their <i>puja </i>festival and this has greatly helped to
      erase the misgiving that JI is a communal force. <o:p>

      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">JI top leaders,
      being government ministers, got ample opportunities to mix with the
      Western diplomats and donors, and create good impression that it is ready
      to work peacefully for social change. They are getting reasonable exposure
      to present their viewpoints both to national and international media. In
      addition, JI leaders in the government are getting the chance to meet the
      world leaders. The interaction of the leaders of the Islamic movement with
      the Western leaders is important for giving a true picture about Islam and
      removing many doubts in the Western mind about Islamic movement that is
      the result of mal propaganda. In the past, it has been seen that the West
      do sometimes intervene in the Third World, especially the Muslim
      countries, because of suspicion and misunderstanding. It is important for
      the Muslim leadership to explain its world vision and points of view
      particularly to those sections of the Western intellectuals and leaders
      who are fair-minded and not agenda-driven. It will help the Muslim
      leadership to expose the prejudiced Westerners in their respective
      countries and to isolate them in their own societies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">By joining the
      government, JI leadership got the first hand direct experience of running
      the government and ‘proved their efficiency’<sup>12</sup>. Both the JI
      ministers have earned ‘good reputation’<sup>13</sup> for their
      honesty, and this has ‘enhanced the good image’<sup>14 </sup>of the JI
      and its leaders among the common people. This has created positive impact
      on the modern and secular educated people about JI whom they found, for
      the first time, a different kind of people. If you walk through the
      corridor of the Bangladesh Secretariat at Eden Building you will have the
      same impression. Until joining the government, JI leadership had
      absolutely no knowledge of the mechanism of the functioning of the
      government. So long the people believed that modern day politicians are
      bound to be corrupt, but JI ministers ushered in hope among them that good
      governance is possible even today, provided leaders are honest. JI
      leadership is getting opportunity to mix with their cabinet colleagues and
      influence the policy makers. It seems, they could influence in such vital
      areas as education by incorporating some of their ideas in the government
      agenda. Some of the Jamaat leaders are of the opinion that it should use
      the current opportunity to expand, consolidate and further strengthen its
      base in the socio-cultural sectors, particularly make efforts to establish
      new NGOs and bring out new and quality newspapers. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The hitherto wrong
      impression held by the elites that JI is not competent, nor is interested
      about the worldly well-being of the people and only allure people for
      benefit in the Hereafter has been partially removed by ‘successful
      handling’<sup>15</sup> of ministries by the leaders of the JI. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Since the
      government is not patronizing terrorism, JI got opportunity to work for
      Islamic <i>dawah. </i>As the environment is relatively peaceful and the
      agenda of the government is not to fight the Islamic forces, JI is
      comparatively getting better and peaceful atmosphere to carry forward the
      Islamic cause without hindrance and concentrate in organizational
      activities, particularly in the development of its manpower. JI, for the
      first time, is getting opportunity to mix with civil and military
      bureaucracy and present its views which is important for the onward march
      and progress of the Islamic call and guidance. Experience has shown that a
      democratic party cannot come to power in Third World countries, specially
      in Muslim countries, even after electoral victory if it is not able to
      establish some sort of understanding or rapport with the army, or if it
      fails to remove misunderstanding about it, or is not able to wipeout
      negative idea about it, or neutralize the army about it. The notable
      example is Algeria where Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) could not come to
      power because Algerian army became a barrier to its ascending to power. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Because JI is in
      the government, it would naturally come to know and identify Islamic
      elements in the government machinery and naturally personal relations
      would be developed between it and friendly elements within the government
      that is essential for the ultimate success of the Islamic movement. It
      would develop support base everywhere in the government that would help to
      exert influence over government policy even if it is not in the
      government.<o:p>

      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">JI got the
      opportunity to mix with workers and leaders of BNP at all levels. This has
      created ‘positive impact’<sup>16</sup> among many in the BNP. Party
      and individual level relations among the partners of the alliance can grow
      if properly nourished. Jamaat thinks that the good ideas and positive
      qualities of JI workers and leaders are influencing others in the
      alliance, and that it has the opportunity to cultivate inter-party
      relations and remove hitherto-held unfounded misunderstanding and
      enlighten others about Jamaat of which people are largely unaware.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Jamaat largely believes that the people have been so far ignorant
      about it.<o:p>

      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The component
      parties of the alliance, particularly BNP and JI, are working in unison-
      up to grass root level, from the capital to Upazilla level. The JI workers
      and leaders are thus getting opportunity to mix with Deputy Commissioners,
      Senior Police officials and other government officials at all levels. They
      are thus getting importance. This is bringing them to exposure and now
      they can serve the interest of the people better. Because JI is in the
      government, it is not becoming the target and victim of the hostile
      administration.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Being part of the
      government JI is getting opportunity to participate in the developmental
      activities in their respective constituencies and create spheres of
      influence, particularly because JI workers and leaders could prove their
      financial integrity and transparency of their conduct.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">JI workers are by
      and large peace loving and not always skillful enough to maneuver and face
      the fascist AL workers. They, therefore, need protection of the
      like-minded groups and individuals. The alliance thus can be effective
      instrument to contain the muscle power of the AL.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

      <p class="MsoBodyText2"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Islam is the
      solution, but is not in itself a blueprint for running a state apparatus.
      The experience in running the government in this trouble-ridden modern
      world is the necessary prerequisite for ultimately establishing Islamic
      social order.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jamaat,
      therefore, says that it’s joining in the alliance is justified.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The senior leaders
      of the Jamaat<sup>17</sup>, however, think that it should be prepared to
      shoulder the burden of collective responsibility of the alliance
      government that might not be very comfortable always; and at the same
      time, its leaders want to be extra-cautious that its already materialist
      workers are not further polluted by materialism because of proximity to
      power, and that power does not increase their lust for money, and that
      they do not deviate from the Islamic way, and lose their Islamic spirit.
      The leaders of Jamaat seem to be determined not to allow moral laxity in
      any way among its workers and to see that they are not contaminated by the
      influence of others and do not loose the sprit of sacrifice. While
      adjusting its programme with the alliance partners, Jamaat leaders want to
      be cautious that it does not develop in it an all time compromising
      attitude to avoid the rough road of struggle. Jamaat wants to be careful
      that it does not give major concessions on the ideological issues,
      although they realize that circumstance might force it to remain silent in
      the face of the corruption by the government leaders, which it thinks
      might blacken Jamaat’s own image. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The Jamaat leaders
      seem to be very much alert that they do not become the victim of the
      conspiracy of a particular group of the partners of the alliance,
      conspiracy hatched by certain leaders or coterie beyond the knowledge of
      the principal leader of the party and that it does not become direct
      target of the major parties of the opposition outside the alliance so that
      JI in no circumstance become adversary of both BNP and AL at the same
      time.<o:p>

      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">It seems that JI
      Chief and Secretary General despite being the ministers are very much
      active in organizational activities, in spite of demanding state
      responsibilities and busy schedules, for they think that a dynamic and
      lively organization is the lifeline to establish Islamic social order, and
      ignoring organizational works might prove suicidal in the long run. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The ultimate
      success of the alliance depends on the goodwill of the partners. It is
      difficult, at this stage, to predict the eventual outcome of the alliance
      with so many ifs and buts, particularly when the partners of the alliance
      have deep conflict of values and interest that apparently are not always
      visible. In spite of many cautions optimism expressed by the JI leaders,
      it seems they are no less concerned about the future of the organization
      because of its proximity to power and its impact on its manpower. Jamaat
      is telling its workers that sharing power and to be in power is not always
      the same thing.</span></p>
