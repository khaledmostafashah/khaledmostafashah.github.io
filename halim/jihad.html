      <p  style="text-align:justify">Jihad is the most 
      misunderstood and much talked about concept. Does it suggest waging war on 
      another people? Is it a war of aggression or a war of self-defense? Is 
      such a war is waged to protect oppressed and persecuted humankind, whether 
      Muslims or non-Muslims in the neighborhood or in a far-flung area? Does 
      Jihad permit Muslims to wage a military expedition for expansion or to 
      conquer a land or to subjugate non-Muslims or force peaceful non-Muslims 
      neighbors to submit to its rule even if such non-Muslims in no way created 
      any trouble for the Muslim state or attempted or instigated to create a 
      rebellious and seditious condition in the Muslim land, treason and 
      subversion, violated or severed a treaty obligation? &nbsp;</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">Muslims history bears no 
      testimony and description - not of a single case - in which Prophet 
      Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) led an aggressive assault. All 
      historical account show that each tribe with which the Muslims fought had 
      earlier besieged and assailed the Muslims first or had aided and assisted 
      such an aggressor. In particular, there is absolutely no proof that 
      suggests that Prophet Muhammad ever offered a peaceful neighboring tribe 
      the choice between accepting Islamic rule or war. Bernard Lewis commented: 
      “In fact state-sponsored persecution or forced conversion of non-Muslims 
      was quite rare in the Islamic world” [Bernard Lewis. The Jews of Islam. 
      Princeton NJ. Princeton University Press. 1984. 27-62]. This has however 
      not stopped prejudiced and unfair historians and writers and Western 
      academicians from searching the vast hadith literature – compilation of 
      the sayings, actions and what Prophet Muhammad has approved by way of not 
      opposing certain thing happening in front of him - and the Prophet’s sirah 
      – biography - in support of war of aggression to establish Islamic rule. &nbsp;</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">The expeditions that the 
      Prophet led do not entail that Muslims are required to impose Islamic rule 
      on all non-Muslims. His military and political decisions were always in 
      agreement with the general ban of Quran against unprovoked aggression. Why 
      then some scholars blamed Islam for aggressive war? It is one thing to 
      fight against a tyrant aggressor and it is all together a different matter 
      to impose a war on a peaceful people for submitting to Muslim rule. The 
      life of Prophet Muhammad does not support such a contention for he never 
      led an attack against a peaceful neighbor who refused to accept Muslim 
      rule. Recorded history depicts that Prophet never fought the pagan tribes 
      who were peaceful and nonviolent and did not break treaty obligation 
      rather Muslims fought on their behalf. </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">Why then some researchers 
      embarked on such prejudiced and biased conclusion that Muslims if become 
      powerful will take up arms to impose their culture on the non-Muslim 
      world? What prompted some scholars to think that clash of civilization 
      between the Muslims and West is inevitable if Muslims ever become powerful 
      and strong in military science and technology? Why and how the West 
      reached such biased and flawed conclusion? This needs to be studied 
      afresh.</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">In this write up an 
      attempt shall be made to pick up those verses of the Quran that are 
      quoted, often out of context, by the Western scholars and researchers to 
      justify their conclusion that Muslims are committed to take up arms to 
      impose their way of life on others and try to explain those verses of the 
      Quran in which some researchers try to find out apparent contradiction. We 
      shall then examine the sirah - the biography of the Prophet - particularly 
      those relating to military expedition, war and intra tribal relations. </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">To grasp the precise 
      meaning of the verse of the Quran we shall use English rendering of the 
      Quran by Abdullah Yusuf Ali, Marmaduke Pikthall, Muhammad Asad, Sayyid 
      Qutub and joint English translation of the meaning of the noble Quran by 
      Dr. Muhammad Muhsin Khan and Dr. Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali. </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">Let us now examine the 
      text of the Quran where war has been made lawful in self-defense. Al Quran 
      states: To those against whom war is made, <i>permission is given to fight 
      because they were wronged </i>and verily Allah is Most Powerful for their 
      aid. They are <i>those who have been expelled from their homes in defiance 
      of right, for no cause</i> <i>except that they say Our Lord is Allah</i>. 
      [Al Quran 22 (Surat Al Hajj):39-40].</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">This two verses revealed 
      in the backdrop of the war situation created as a result of the hijrah – 
      migration to Madinah - pin point the attitude of Islam as best explained 
      in the Quran towards war – just and rational.</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">The Quran also urges the 
      Muslims to fight tyrant and oppressive people. Al Quran states: And what 
      is wrong with you that you <i>fight not in the cause of Allah and for 
      those weak, ill-treated and oppressed</i> among men, women and children 
      whose cry is: Our Lord! Rescue us from this town whose people are 
      oppressors and raise for us from You one who will protect and raise for us 
      from You one who will help [Al Quran 4 (Surat An Nisaa): 75]. </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">The above quoted verses of 
      the Quran make it clear that war is only permissible to correct a wrong 
      and when oppressed and persecuted or on behalf of the oppressed or 
      persecuted and ONLY on self-defense.</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">Al Quran further 
      elaborated the principle of self-defense: Fight in the cause of Allah <i>
      against those who fight you</i> but <i>do not transgress limits</i> for 
      Allah does not love transgressors. And slay them whenever you catch them 
      and turn them out from where they have turned you out for persecution is 
      worse than killing … But <i>if they cease</i>, Allah is Oft-forgiving Most 
      Merciful [ Al Quran 2 (Surat Al Baqarah): 190-192].</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">Al Quran states: And <i>
      fight them on until there is no more persecution</i> …. But <i>if they 
      cease</i>, let <i>there be no hostility except to those who practice 
      oppression</i> [Al Quran 2 (Surat Al Baqarah):193].</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">Al Quran states: If then
      <i>any one transgresses the prohibition against you, transgress you</i> <i>
      likewise</i> against him. But fear Allah and know that <i>Allah is with 
      those who restrain themselves</i> [Al Quran 2 (Surat Al Baqarah):194].</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">Al Quran states: Others 
      you will find that wish to be secure from you as well as that of their 
      people. Every time they are sent back to temptation, they succumb thereto.
      <i>If they withdraw not from you nor give you guarantees of peace besides 
      restraining their hands, seize them and slay them whenever you get them.</i> 
      In their case We have provided you with a clear argument against them [Al 
      Quran 4 (Surat An Nisaa):91].</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">Al Quran states: But <i>if 
      the enemy inclines towards peace, you also incline towards peace</i> and 
      trust in Allah. Verily He is All-Hearer, the All-Knower [Al Quran 8 (Surat 
      Al Anfal):61].</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">Al Quran states: Allah 
      does <i>not forbid you to deal justly and kindly with those who fought not 
      against you on account of religion </i>and did not drive you out of your 
      homes. Verily Allah loves those who deal with equity. It is only as 
      regards those who fought against you on account of religion and have 
      driven you out of your homes and helped to drive you out that Allah 
      forbids you to befriend them. And whosoever will befriend them, then such 
      are the wrong-doers [Al Quran 60 (Surat Al Mumtahinah):8-9].</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">Al Quran states: Let there 
      be no compulsion in religion [Al Quran 2 (Surat Al Baqarah):256].</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">Thus it is clear from the 
      above quoted verses of Al Quran [Surat Al Hajj:39-40, Surat An Nisaa: 75, 
      Surat Al Baqarah: 190-194, Surat An Nisaa: 91, Surat Al Anfal: 61, Surat 
      Al Mumtahinah: 8-9 and Surat Al Baqarah: 256] that fighting is only 
      allowed on self-defense, in defense of victims of cruelty and oppression 
      and there is no question for the use of aggression as a means to force 
      non-Muslims states to accept Islamic rule. Al Sarakhsi put forth the 
      position of al Thawri, shared by many other juristic authorities such as 
      ibn Umar, Ata, Amar ibn Dinar and Ibn Shibrimah that fighting is not an 
      obligation unless the initiative comes from the enemy [Dr. AbdulHamid A. 
      AbuSulayman. Towards an Islamic Theory of International Relations: New 
      Directions for Methodology and Thought. pp9 &amp; 23. IIIT, USA]. </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">In fact the debate whether 
      Jihad is a defensive war or a war of aggression is unwarranted for those 
      who advocate war base their argument that an aggressive war becomes an 
      obligation on the Muslims if they are not allowed to preach their religion 
      which in to day’s world is very difficult nay impossible. The comment made 
      by Prof. Dr. Yusuf Al Qaradawi, Dean of the Faculty of Shariah and Islamic 
      Studies, University of Qatar in this connection is most pertinent. He 
      said: “No force can stand in our way today if we act in earnest and devote 
      our efforts to conveying our dawah to the whole world. The spoken, written 
      and televised word can be spread all over the world in all languages by 
      radio, television, books, messages, the press and&nbsp; the Muslim communities 
      in all countries of the world” [Prof. Dr. Yusuf Al Qaradawi. Priorities of 
      the Islamic Movement in the Coming Phase. p121. Awakening Publications. 
      UK]. <u>To this we may add the scope provided by internet. </u></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">Still then some scholars 
      tried to malign Islam arguing that Islam believes in military expansion 
      and often quotes verse 9 (Surat At Tauba): 5 which has been revealed 
      against the backdrop of violation of the Treaty of Hudaybiyah. This verse 
      revealed seven years after migration of Muslim to Madinah from Makkah 
      states: But when the forbidden months are past, then fight and slay the 
      pagans wherever you find them, and seize them, beleaguer them and lie in 
      wait for them in every stratagem of war; but if thy repent, and establish 
      regular prayers and pay zakah then open the way for them for Allah is 
      Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful [Al Quran-9 (Surat At Tauba): 5] </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">But a glimpse at the 
      context shows that this verse is directed against those who, through 
      deceit and treachery, break their solemn pledges and formal treaties with 
      the Muslims. This becomes clear if verse 9 (Surat At Tauba): 5 is read 
      together with preceding verse 9 (Surat At Tauba): 4 which states: But the 
      treaties are not dissolved with those pagans with whom you have entered 
      into alliance and who have not subsequently failed you in aught, nor aided 
      anyone against you. So fulfill your engagements with them to the end of 
      their term for Allah love the righteous [Al Quran-9 (Surat At Tauba): 4]</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">Al Quran further elucidate 
      and clarify: As long as these stand true to you, stand you true to them 
      for Allah does love the righteous [Al Quran 9 (Surat At Tauba):7].</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">A careful reading and 
      analysis of verse 9 (Surat At Tauba):5, 9 (Surat At Tauba): 4, 9 (Surat At 
      Tauba):7, and verses 22 (Surat Al Hajj):39-40, 4 (Surat An Nisaa): 75, 2 (Surat 
      Al Baqarah): 190-194, 4 (Surat An Nisaa):91, 8 (Surat Al Anfal):61, 60 (Surat 
      Al Mumtahinah):8-9, 2 (Surat Al Baqarah):256, quoted above will show that 
      there is essentially no contradiction between these verses. While verse 9 
      (Surat At Tauba):5 for all intents and purposes deals with treaty 
      violators and not a permission to engage in military engagement for 
      territorial aggrandizement, seize or expansion, other verses just 
      mentioned and quoted above prohibit military aggression. Thus it is 
      established that while it is permissible to deal with treaty violators, 
      general military engagement is not permissible to conquer a land or to 
      impose Islamic culture and Muslim rule and forceful conversion to Islam. 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">Some earlier commentators 
      of the Quran however resorted to theory of <i>naskh</i> – abrogation - to 
      justify that verse 9 (Surat At Tauba): 5 indeed permits military 
      aggression against a non-Muslims that refuse to surrender to Islamic rule. 
      This group of scholars in order to justify their argument and 
      interpretation and to reconcile the apparent contradiction between verse 9 
      (Surat At Tauba): 5 and other verses that prohibit aggression suggested 
      abrogation of as many as 114 verses spread over as many as 54 surahs – 
      chapters of the Quran - endorsing that peace was revoked by 9 (Surat At 
      Tauba): 5, and 2 (Surat Al Baqarah): 216. [Mohammad Arkoun. Rethinking 
      Islam. Translated by Robert D Lee. Boulder Co. Westwiew Press. 1994]. Ibn 
      al Arabi and Ibn Salamah believed that verse 9 (Surat At Tauba): 5 had 
      abrogated a total of 124 verses. Mustafa Abu Zayd says that he found the 
      number of verses that were abrogated by the same verse<u> </u>to exceed 
      140 [Dr. AbdulHamid A. AbuSulayman. Towards an Islamic Theory of 
      International Relations: New Directions for Methodology and Thought. p 44. 
      IIIT, USA]. </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">Verse 9 (Surat At Tauba): 
      5 quoted earlier states: &nbsp;But when the forbidden months are past, then 
      fight and slay the pagans wherever you find them, and seize them, 
      beleaguer them and lie in wait for them in every stratagem of war; but if 
      thy repent, and establish regular prayers and pay zakah then open the way 
      for them for Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful. Verse 2 (Surat Al 
      Baqarah): 216 states: Fighting is prescribed upon you and you dislike it. 
      But it is possible that you dislike a thing which is good for you and that 
      you love a thing which is bad for you. But Allah knows and you know not.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">But this theory of 
      abrogation is defective in itself for there is no record in the <i>
      authentic </i>hadith that Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon 
      him) advocated such a view that certain verses of the Quran have been <i>
      revoked permanently</i> [Muhammad Asad. The Message of the Quran. pp 
      22-23. Footnote 87. Dar Al Andalus, Gibralter. 1980]. In the absence of 
      conclusive proof that reaches up to the Prophet, the saying of any 
      Companion of the Prophet, from juristic point of view, is only a personal 
      opinion. Moreover, verses were revealed on specific occasion to address 
      changing circumstances and social milieus. Often a verse of the Quran was 
      revealed to further explain or elaborate a verse earlier revealed as in 
      the case of drinking alcohol. The final injunction of the Quran on wine 
      only complement the earlier revelations and in no way contradictory to the 
      previous revelations. The Quran on occasions would revise prior 
      instructions in the light of <i>changed</i> circumstances as in the case 
      of verse 9 (Surat At Tauba): 5 revealed against the background of 
      violation of the Treaty of Hudaybiyah as explained earlier, but here 
      again, since different commands deal with different circumstances and 
      state of affairs, there is no reason to infer and construe a conflict 
      between these. Hence there is no reason to conclude that a certain verse 
      of the Quran has been <i>rescinded or invalidated permanently</i> by 
      another verse. There is however no way to use Quran in support waging war 
      other than self-dense or against oppression without taking the recourse of 
      the theory of abrogation of the verses of the Quran.&nbsp; </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">The theory of abrogation 
      was used to reconcile what apparently appeared to certain Muslim scholars 
      contradictory, but a deep and piercing insight and close scrutiny will 
      establish that there is no contradiction in the teaching of the Quran. In 
      verse 4 (Surat An Nisa): 82 the Quran itself testifies that there is 
      contradiction in the Quran. Verse 4 (Surat An Nisa): 82 states: Do they 
      not ponder on the Quran? Had it from other than Allah, they would surely 
      have found therein much discrepancy.</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">Thus when interpreting the 
      verses of the Quran, the context in which these verses were revealed must 
      not go unnoticed or must not be ignored for then you run the risk of 
      landing in wilderness and likely committing mistake considering an 
      exception for a general rule and vice versa or to construct a conflict 
      between verses where none exists.</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">Prophet Muhammad received 
      revelation in three consecutive periods – the Makkan period during which 
      the Muslims suffered in the hands of the pagan Arabs but still then did 
      not resort to confrontation and open hostility. The second period starts 
      from the hijrah<u> </u>– migration to Madinah from Makkah commonly known 
      as first Madinan period, the period that covered the arrival of the 
      Prophet to Madinah until the signing the treaty of Hudaybiyah during which 
      Prophet tried to organize the Muslims community to use force in answering 
      force and discourage the enemies from attempting to use violence against 
      the Muslims. The third period, the period from the day of signing of the 
      treaty of Hudabiyah until the death of Prophet, the period commonly known 
      as second Madinan period during which the Muslim community got fully 
      organized to deal with opponents and the new Muslim state dealt with 
      patience and understanding towards its enemies and neighbors. </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">Now to suggest that the 
      legal ruling during the second phase of Madinan period after signing the 
      treaty of Hudaybiyah and the conquest of Makkah is only valid might create 
      obstacles for the future generations of Muslims. The concept of naskh – 
      the abrogation of earlier by the later revelation may make it difficult 
      for the future Muslims to survive for the abrogation might nullify or 
      limit the scope of the applicability of the legislation of the Quran. We 
      need not forget that new political and international situations may arise 
      which did not at all take place during the life time of the Prophet</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">Moreover, as Dr. 
      AbdulHamid A. AbuSulayman puts it, “if the meaning of Islam is restricted 
      to the interpretation of events which occurred during a time of 
      hostilities near the very end of the Prophet’s era; while the rest of the 
      whole spectrum of the Quranic and Sunnah texts and the experience of the 
      earlier Makkan and Madinan periods are ignored, then it will not be 
      possible in the future for mankind to pursue justice or even to survive” 
      [Dr. AbdulHamid A. AbuSulayman. Towards an Islamic Theory of International 
      Relations: New Directions for Methodology and Thought. p 45. IIIT, USA].
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">It would also be wrong to 
      suggest that Muslim would always remain the ruling class and they 
      therefore need not worry about the teaching of the Quran prior to the 
      period of signing of the treaty of Hudaybiyah. The teachings of Islam 
      should be considered as a whole keeping the higher objectives, purposes 
      and principles of shariah uppermost. Individuals and societies in 
      different times and places will differ according to their circumstances, 
      opportunities, needs and challenges and therefore their response are also 
      likely to be different. Al Zuhayli commented: “The position of the 
      classical jurists that war is the permanent basis (for international 
      relations) is not an authority that is binding on anyone. It has no 
      support from the Quran and the Sunnah. It is merely a decision (ruling) of 
      temporary effect” [W al Zuhali, Athar al Harb. p135. Quoted in Dr. 
      AbdulHamid A. AbuSulayman. Towards an Islamic Theory of International 
      Relations: New Directions for Methodology and Thought. p 85. IIIT, USA]. 
      The question of abrogation of the certain verses of the Quran therefore 
      does not arise for Islam is the last deen to deal with the ever changing 
      milieu, now and in future.&nbsp; </p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">Verses 9 (Surat At Tauba): 
      29 &amp; 123 are sometimes quoted to justify for aggression against 
      non-combatant states not in any way involved in aggression against Islamic 
      states in order to bring such countries under Islamic rule. Verse 9 (Surat 
      At Tauba): 29 states: Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last 
      Day, nor hold that forbidden which has<u> </u>been forbidden by Allah and 
      His Messenger, nor acknowledge the Religion of Truth from among the People 
      of the Book, until they pay jizya with willing submission and feel 
      themselves subdued. Verses 9 (Surat At Tauba):123 states: O you who 
      believe! Fight the unbelievers who are near to you and let them find 
      harshness in you and know that Allah is with those who fear Him. Some 
      scholars are of the view that such an interpretation of the two 
      aforementioned verses are in conflict with the context of revelation and 
      against the very sprit of the preceding verses and would require large <i>
      scale abrogation </i>which is a subject of great dispute among the 
      scholars. They argue that verse 9 (Surat At Tauba): 29 should not be 
      considered in isolation from the other verses of the Quran rather be 
      studied as an integral part of the Quran as a whole and particularly read 
      together with verse&nbsp; 2 (Surat Al Baqarah): 190-194 quoted above that 
      permits war only on self defense [Muhammad Asad. The Message of the Quran. 
      p 261. Footnote 40]. Muhammad Abduh in his commentary of the Quran also 
      holds the same view [Manar X. 332]. Muhammad Asad commenting on the words 
      “nor hold that forbidden which has been forbidden by Allah and His 
      Messenger” of the verse 9 (Surat At Tauba): 29 observed that what Allah 
      has forbidden is “unprovoked war” [Muhammad Asad. The Message of the Quran.. 
      p 261. Footnote 41].Dr. AbdulHalmid A. AbuSulayman commenting on the words 
      “feel themselves subdued” (Arabic word used is saghar) of the verse 9 (Surat 
      At Tauba): 29 observed that subdued or saghar is “not intended to apply 
      automatically to all non-Muslims. Saghar is not an attitude and punishment 
      for choosing a different belief, but for a hostile and treacherous 
      attitude against Muslim peoples and in opposition to justice and to the 
      Islamic obligation to protect man’s right to safety and freedom of belief” 
      [Towards an Islamic Theory of International Relations: New Directions for 
      Methodology and Thought. p 50]. Commenting on the words “fight the 
      unbelievers who are near to you” in verse 9 (Surat At Tauba):123 Moulana 
      Mawdudi noted that these words for all intent and purpose point towards 
      the hypocrites, the enemy within the Muslim society. This becomes clear if 
      verse 9 (Surat At Tauba):123 is read together with the succeeding verse [Sayyid 
      Abul Ala Mawdudi. Towards Understanding the Quran. p 274. Footnote 121. 
      Vo. III.&nbsp; The Islamic Foundation, UK]. &nbsp;</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">Some others scholars often 
      quote verses 2 (Surat Al Baqarah):106 and 16 (Surat An Nahl):101 to 
      support abrogation to justify hostility and aggression against 
      non-combatant states not in any way involved in aggression against Islamic 
      states in order to bring such countries under Islamic rule. Verse 2 (Surat 
      Al Baqarah):106 states: None of Our revelations do We abrogate or cause to 
      be forgotten, but We substitute something better or similar, know you not 
      that Allah has power to do all things. Again verse 16 (Surat An Nahl):101 
      states: When We substitute one revelation for another, and Allah knows 
      best what He reveals in stages. They say- You are but a forger. But most 
      of them know not. But the context of the revelation of the verses 2 (Surat 
      Al Baqarah):106 and 16 (Surat An Nahl):101 indicate that the annulled 
      revelations of the two verses are connected with the period of earlier 
      Prophets and not of Prophet Muhammad [John Burton. The Collection of the 
      Quran. Cambridge University Press. 1977. 237-240. Also Muhammad Asad. The 
      Message of the Quran. pp 22-23. Footnote 87].</p>
      <p style="text-align:justify">Verse 9 (Surat At Tauba): 
      29 [Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that 
      forbidden which has been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor 
      acknowledge the Religion of Truth from among the People of the Book, until 
      they pay jizya with willing submission and feel themselves subdued] is 
      subject to limits and conditions laid down in verse 2 (Surat Al Baqarah): 
      190 [Fight in the cause of Allah <i>against those who fight you</i> but <i>
      do not transgress limits</i> for Allah does not love transgressors] - both 
      the verses also quoted and discussed above – which allows war only on 
      self-defense leaving no scope for the Muslims to be aggressive in war or 
      impose Islamic rule on the non-Muslims. This has been clearly&nbsp; 
      demonstrated by the last expedition of the Prophet Muhammad, a difficult 
      journey to Tabuk, against the Byzantine on the basis reports that the 
      Byzantine plans to attack the new Muslim state of Hejaj which later proved 
      not to be authentic, Prophet returned without attacking them. Later 
      investigation established that the objective of Byzantine concentration 
      was not Muslims rather certain northern Arab tribes who had been allies to 
      Byzantine but who were then defying Byzantine authority [Jeffery Lang. 
      Even Angles Ask. amana publications. Maryland, USA. p128]. </p>
      <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">The 
      saying of the Prophet reported by Bukhari and Muslim that: I have been 
      ordered to fight against people until they testify that there is no god 
      but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah and until they 
      perform the prayers and pay the zakah [Quoted in An Nawawi’s Forty Hadith. 
      Translated by I. Ezzedin Ibrahim and Denys Johnson Davies. The Holy Koran 
      Publishing House, Damascus, Syria.1977. p 46] and verse 9 (Surat At Tauba):11 
      [But even so, if they repent, establish regular prayers and pay zakah, 
      they are your brethren in faith. Thus do We explain the signs in detail 
      for those who understand] have created confusion in some minds as if Islam 
      believes in forceful conversion. Such conclusion is the result of the 
      reading of the certain verse of the Quran in isolation with others.&nbsp; But 
      if the aforementioned saying of the Prophet and verse 9 (Surat At Tauba):11 
      are read together with verse 9 (Surat At Tauba):5 [But when the forbidden 
      months are past, then fight and slay the pagans wherever you find them, 
      and seize them, beleaguer them and lie in wait for them in every stratagem 
      of war; but if thy repent, and establish regular prayers and pay zakah 
      then open the way for them for Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful] 
      which has been revealed against the backdrop of violation of the Treaty of 
      Hudaybiyah and quoted earlier and verses 9 (Surat At Tauba):12-13 [But if 
      they violate their oaths after their covenant and attack your faith, fight 
      you the chiefs of unfaith for their oaths are nothing for them. That thus 
      they may be restrained. Will you not fight people who violated their 
      oaths, plotted to expel the Messenger and attack you first? Do you fear 
      them? Nay, it is Allah Whom you should more justly fear, if you believe] 
      the Islamic principle of war becomes crystal clear. Thus the question of 
      forceful conversion at the point of sward or to impose Islamic culture and 
      way of life on the non-Muslims by the ruling Islamic state is an exercise 
      of the prejudiced mind lacking scholarly acumen.&nbsp; Karen Armstrong rightly 
      pointed out - “Islamic law forbids Muslims to declare war against a 
      country in which Muslims are allowed to practice their religion freely, 
      and it strongly prohibits the killing of innocent civilians” [Karen 
      Armstrong. Islam: A Short History. p190. The Modern Library. New York].</span></td>
