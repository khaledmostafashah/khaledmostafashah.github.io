      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">A section of the politicians, elite 
      and members of the civil society suspect that Jamaat-i-Islami Bangladesh, 
      the oldest, most organized and resourceful Islamic political party of the 
      country as is reflected in the massive turn up of people in its recent 
      grand rally at Paltan Maidan, Dhaka, is behind all militant activities in 
      the name of Islam throughout Bangladesh. One reason behind such suspicion 
      is that those who have resorted to bombings are doing so in the name of 
      Islam, like Jamaat raising the same slogan (implementation of God’s Law- 
      Shariah) and some of them had link with the Jamaat in distant past. They 
      also allege that of all the Islamic groups of the country only Jamaat has 
      the highly motivated workforce to implement any program throughout the 
      country.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">The other reason behind the 
      suspicion is that Jamaat, in 1971, took up arms by joining paramilitary 
      forces like Razaker and tried to impose its will and agenda on the 
      majority of people who are then fighting an all-out war for liberation. 
      Jamaat is still a small and minor political pressure group, and has 18 
      directly elected MPs plus 3 women MPs in the Parliament, and a section of 
      people suspect that Jamaat might again try, like 1971, to impose its 
      agenda on the majority of people who during the last 35 years did not 
      accept it as a political alternative. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Jamaat manpower study Egyptian 
      Muslim Brotherhood leader Sayyid Qutb’s book ‘Milestones’ (Bangla 
      translation - Islami Samaj Biplaber Dhara). Western scholars believe, 
      rightly or wrongly, that this book supports rebellion to overthrow 
      Jahiliyyah<b> </b>government. Some people are raising eyebrow as to why 
      this book is in the list of compulsory reading materials of the Jamaat’s 
      manpower. This is another reason for suspecting Jamaat of involvement with 
      militant activities.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">The civil society members, not to 
      speak of politicians, largely believe, which is also shared by western 
      powers, that Jamaat’s student wing Islami Chhatra Shibir is heavily armed 
      in Chittagong University and Rajshahi University, the two major public 
      universities of the country, which is another reason for suspecting Jamaat 
      of involvement with terrorist activity.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Due to the propaganda of a large 
      number of newspapers and political weeklies, a section of the people have 
      become suspicious of Jamaat’s link with Jama’atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), 
      its leader Sheakh Abdur Rahman and think that Jamaat is behind all recent 
      militant activities and is engaged in a proxy war to impose its agenda on 
      the people. Some newspaper columnists have also expressed their misgiving 
      of Jamaat’s alleged link with the militants. This has given some 
      credibility to the propaganda.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">External forces who are affected, 
      this way or that, by the four party alliance government actions identify 
      Jamaat, not being able to manipulate Jamaat in favor of their interest, 
      with the alleged militancy to discredit Jamaat for they think that Jamaat 
      is the brain behind all actions of the government that went against their 
      interest and harmed them.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Political players, who want to see 
      the end of BNP-Jamaat four party alliance government, are creating 
      confusion in the mind of the voters raising the tricky claim of Jamaat 
      involvement with terrorism to diminish political prospect of the four 
      party alliance government in the ensuing parliamentary elections. The 
      objective of such propaganda is to isolate BNP from Jamaat and create 
      political environment where fourteen party alliance led by Bangladesh 
      Awami League could smoothly sail through the rough sea of upcoming 
      parliamentary elections to be held on 2007.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">The natural question that arises: 
      Does Jamaat believe in armed revolt? This is a question that needs to be 
      addressed. It would be appropriate to quote Moulana Mawdudi, the Jamaat 
      ideologue, to ascertain Jamaat viewpoint on capturing power through armed 
      revolt.&nbsp; Moulana Mawdudi in 1969 in an interview with Ziauddin Sardar 
      published in The Muslim, the FOSIS magazine, reproduced in Radiance Views 
      Weekly, Delhi, India in its issue of 31 July – 6 August 2005 rejected the 
      idea of armed revolt.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">To a question: “Do you think that 
      the Islamic state can be established by an armed revolt?” Moulana Mawdudi 
      replied categorically: “I do not think this is the right road for us to 
      pursue. Such a policy, instead of producing any good, may prove to be 
      highly harmful.”</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Moulana Mawdudi elaborated: “Even 
      if yes- establish an Islamic state through armed revolution, it would not 
      be possible to run the state and carry on its affairs in accordance with 
      the Islamic way, for the simple reason that society and its different 
      sections have not been properly prepared for the moral transformation that 
      Islam wants. Armed revolution as a means to power is open to others as 
      well - so there is a danger that Muslim countries will become ensnared in 
      a vicious circle of revolutions and counter-revolutions and of 
      conspiracies and counter-conspiracies. Moreover, to bring about an armed 
      revolution, you have to organize your movement on the pattern of secret 
      societies. These have a temperament of their own. They admit to no dissent 
      and disagreement. The voice of criticism is silenced, and free, fair and 
      frank discussions become conspicuous by their absence. Another demand of 
      the inner logic of secret societies is to permit workers to resort to 
      deceit, lies, forgeries, frauds, bloodshed and many other things, which 
      are forbidden in Islam. It is also in the nature of revolutions brought 
      about by the bullet that they can be maintained only through the bullet. 
      This produces a climate where a peaceful switchover towards an Islamic 
      order becomes virtually impossible”. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Moulana Mawdudi is the ideologue of 
      Jamaat. Jamaat still mostly follows his line of thinking. It is, however, 
      natural that difference might crop up in any ideological movement. Such 
      split is common in any ideological movement as is seen in the national and 
      international communist movement that split into many fractions due to 
      differences. Jamaat’s student wing Islami Chhatra Shibir also split after 
      the Iranian revolution due to strategic differences. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">The West is not allowing democratic 
      governments to flourish in the Muslim countries when such governments go 
      against its interest (West attitude towards Hamas is an example) and 
      failure of the corrupt pseudo democratic governments to solve the problems 
      of the Muslim countries has encouraged frustrated utopian people, the 
      seasonal birds in politics, to take up arms to establish government with 
      the slogan of establishing Islam.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">In the backdrop of nine eleven and 
      the U.S. appearing in the global scene as the lone superpower trying to 
      impose its hegemony, split in the nationalist movements across the world 
      as to how to face the imperialist power is a common phenomenon. Due to 
      difference of strategy, people leaving one organization and forming new 
      one is a common practice. Jamaat is also no exception. Some people having 
      link with the Jamaat later leaving Jamaat and joining JMB, therefore, 
      cannot be ruled out. The mainstream Jamaat, however, cannot be blamed for 
      wrong committed by others. </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">It is high time to take a critical 
      look to the agenda of the Jamaat, evaluate afresh its policy, program, 
      manifesto and above all its vast literature. Islamic resurgence is a 
      worldwide phenomenon, and the West and its local agents in the Third World 
      Muslim countries oppose Islamic movements as they oppose the western 
      interests. Leadership of the Islamic movement is committed to protect 
      Muslim interest, political, military, economic and cultural, and nobody 
      should confuse constitutional fight to protect national interest with 
      militancy. It is high time to make distinction between terrorism and 
      struggle for national liberation. Efforts to protect national interest 
      should not and cannot be equated with terrorism.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">Some civil society members think 
      that Jamaat has not sufficiently explained its position vis a vis armed 
      rebellion against established government and renouncing terrorism. Jamaat 
      should, therefore, come out openly to explain its differences with other 
      Islamic groups although it is clear from the views of its principal 
      ideologue Moulana Mawdudi, quoted earlier, that Jamaat is committed to 
      follow constitutional, democratic and peaceful means for any change over 
      or transformation of the government and ascending to power. </p>
      <p align="justify">
      <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">The members 
      of the civil society also feel that Jamaat has not sufficiently clarified 
      its involvement with the Pakistan army in 1971, joining paramilitary 
      forces and its alleged link with intellectual killing. The civil society 
      members and thousands of independent Islamic workers, activists and 
      da’iyah- the caller of Islam feel that Jamaat shall not be able to make 
      headway in Bangladesh politics, shall never get single majority, not to 
      speak of two thirds majority, in the parliament and shall remain a wayside 
      minor force unless it be able to clear peoples mind of their mistrust 
      about Jamaat of it taking part with Pakistan army in 1971 which is the 
      reason of suspecting Jamaat of connection with recent militant activities 
      throughout Bangladesh. Islamic activists in and outside Bangladesh raised 
      a very pertinent question: How come Jamaat is so isolated from people and 
      various Islamic groups that a militant organization like JMB could 
      flourish in Bangladesh and Jamaat is not aware of it?</span></td>
