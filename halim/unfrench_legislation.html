      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The French parliament – 
      the lower house has passed a bill proposing to ban the use of headscarf- 
      Hijab by the Muslim girls in public schools of France. It will now go to 
      the senate and then to French president for signing. If the bill can get 
      through the senate and President Jacques Chirac signs it, it will become a 
      law.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The attempt to ban Muslim 
      girls from attending public schools with headscarf- Hijab is not a new 
      phenomenon. As back as 1989 Ernest Cheniere, who later became a member of 
      French Legislative Body, first banned headscarf- Hijab wearing girls from 
      his school in north Paris.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">It is amazing that France 
      that claims itself to be the cradle of civilization and the torch bearer 
      of <i>liberty, equality and fraternity</i> doing something which 
      tantamount to interfering the individual liberty. Indeed this is against 
      the lofty objective of French revolution and very much unfrench. French 
      role during the recent US war on Iraq was very much appreciated throughout 
      the Muslim world and people thought that France has revised her policy 
      towards the Muslims. People thought that France wouldn’t repeat her 
      negative policy as she did in the case of Algeria where she supported the 
      military junta against the aspiration of the people for a democratic rule. 
      But the recent move to ban the use of headscarf-Hijab by the Muslims girls 
      in public schools is really frustrating. It seems that France could not 
      get out of her colonial mentality. France, in the past, ruled most of the 
      North Africa and other colonies with great brutality.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">To justify her action, 
      France is telling that the use of headscarf-Hijab is a threat to her 
      policy of secularism and nationalism. But this is far from truth. In fact 
      secularism presupposes pluralism and multiculturalism in which every group 
      has right to fashion its life to its liking. Every group and sub-group has 
      right to preserve its own culture and therefore we see movement worldwide 
      to protect even the culture of the aboriginals. It is well established 
      that secularism and democracy mean genuine pluralism and diversity of 
      faiths, cultures and life-styles. The ban on the use of headscarf by the 
      Muslim girls is, no doubt, encroachment on fundamental rights, violation 
      of human rights and indeed discriminatory. It seems that secularism has 
      become more important to the French government than her three original 
      well-known principles - <i>liberty, equality and fraternity</i>. France 
      now needs to add the slogan of <i>secularism</i> to its three famous 
      slogans of freedom, equality and fraternity, reported <i>Le Figaro</i> on 
      17 December 2003 in front page headline.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The religious freedom, 
      including the right of a person to express his or her religious identity 
      in a manner he or she deems appropriate is integral to the secular notion 
      of human rights. The use of headscarf- Hijab by the Muslim girls in no way 
      infringing the right of other religious community and their liberty and 
      therefore using headscarf- Hijab cannot be termed as anti-secular.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">In a democracy, every 
      group has its rights to choose its own way, fashion its life and dress 
      according to its faith, tradition and culture. The Muslim girls use 
      headscarf- Hijab&nbsp; &nbsp;as a sign of modesty. The proposed law, no doubt, is 
      anti-democratic for it attacks on privacy and life-style. It is violation 
      of cultural rights, so to say cultural oppression and tyranny<u>.</u> It 
      is sheer fascism and a form of cultural imperialism.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The proposed law is 
      discriminatory for it allows the Christians to use small cross. It is 
      hypocritical for even after the enactment of the law the Christians can 
      use cross, for cross can be concealed, while the Muslim girls cannot use 
      headscarf - Hijab for headscarf cannot be concealed and the French 
      government understands it.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Moreover, in the absence 
      of &nbsp;enough private Muslim schools and due to limited financial capability 
      - the Muslims parents cannot withdraw their daughters from the public 
      schools to send them to private schools, for private schools are very much 
      expensive compared to public schools. The French government, fully aware 
      of this situation, has proposed the ban of headscarf - Hijab only in 
      public school.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">France, the proud upholder 
      of liberty, is trying to justify the ban on Muslims girls’ use of 
      headscarf- Hijab, for what she says, to preserve national values arguing 
      that such cultural symbols are against the spirit of national cohesion and 
      harmony, integration and assimilation of different immigrant groups with 
      the mainstream and a threat to national security. The fact is that ban on 
      the use of headscarf- Hijab will only isolate the Muslim girls and weaken 
      their chance for integration. &nbsp;Such an attitude is against the very sprit 
      of democracy and fraternity and only depicts the intolerant attitude of 
      the French ruling elite. It is very difficult to understand how a square 
      meter cloth used as headscarf- Hijab can undo a nation like French.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The proposed law is a 
      violation of human rights. Article 9 of the ECHR and Article 18 of the 
      Universal Declaration of Human Rights clearly states: “<i>Everyone has the 
      right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion; this right includes 
      freedom to change his religion or belief and freedom, either alone or in 
      community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion 
      or belief, in worship, teaching, practice and observance</i>”. Denying the 
      Muslim girls the right to wear headscarf- Hijab, dress in accordance with 
      their conscience, faith and tradition is an attack on their right to 
      privacy and life-style. There cannot be a more flagrant abuse of human 
      rights in the name of secularism and nationalism. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">This ban is not an attack 
      on a piece of cloth but a direct attack upon Islam and the identity of 
      Muslim women and a violation of religious rights. The proposed move to ban 
      headscarf- Hijab is not an isolated incident and should be seen in the 
      wider context of the issue of freedom of the Muslims to practice their 
      religion in France. France has the largest Muslim community in Europe- 
      around six million Muslims and the number of Muslims living in France is 
      likely to be ten million if we include those who do not have papers and 
      therefore she suffers from Islamophobia. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Islam is State Religion in 
      Bangladesh, but we have not imposed any dress code on anyone. Everyone can 
      go his or her way. She may cover with headscarf, she may not. She may 
      veil- cover her face and may not. It is her business. We don’t interfere. 
      This freedom is essential part of our culture and in no way threatens our 
      national unity and cohesion. If we in Bangladesh can go without any strict 
      dress code why France cannot? The Muslim belief is that there is no 
      compulsion in religion – la ikraha fiddin [Surat Al Baqarah: 256].</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">We hope that good sense 
      will prevail and France, the cradle of Western civilization, will not 
      further proceed with its policy of cultural victimization and must not 
      make Muslim women a victim of cultural aggression and will allow them to 
      live in France as a peaceful community committed to preserve their 
      cultural values, norms and traditions and practice their religion.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The French government 
      possibly cannot force the schools run and managed by the Church to follow 
      suit and definitely the French government cannot force the Christian Nuns 
      to forgo the use of headscarf. Then what is the purpose of such 
      legislation that will ban the use of headscarf- Hijab in the public 
      schools by the Muslim girls. One may raise the legitimate question whether 
      Mary (peace be upon her) with headscarf is also a threat to French 
      secularism, democracy, national integration and its lofty ideals of 
      liberty, equality and fraternity. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">It is simply ridiculous to 
      think headscarf- Hijab symbolizes sexual inequality and imprisonment of 
      women while similar observations are not made about the Catholic Nuns who 
      use headscarf. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The allegation that 
      headscarf- Hijab is the symbol of oppression and the French government is 
      banning headscarf- Hijab to liberate women is also not valid. If 
      headscarf- Hijab is oppressive why so many Western women are converting to 
      Islam? Islam is the fastest growing religion in the West and the number of 
      women converts to Islam is more than men.&nbsp; </p>
      <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">The West 
      must not forget that it alone is responsible for the rise of extremism in 
      the Muslim world. It is frustration that breads terrorism. France must 
      realize that ban on the use of headscarf-Hijab by the Muslim girls will 
      only antagonize the Muslims. Ban on the use of headscarf-Hijab by the 
      Muslim girls is indeed a cultural aggression and a form of state terrorism 
      by the French government. The West must not put the Muslim in a situation 
      where the Christian West and the Muslims confront each other and make a 
      situation where the clash of civilization seemingly becomes apparent. The 
      West should adopt the policy of dialogue with the Muslims for that alone 
      can make the world an abode of peace.</span></td>
