      <p align="justify">Classical jurists had divided the world 
        into dar al-Islam (the abode of peace) and dar al- harb (the abode of 
        war). Dar al-Islam refers to territories in which Muslims are free and 
        secure and dar al-harb is the opposite of dar al-Islam, and refers primarily 
        to non-Muslim territories hostile to Muslims and dangerous to their freedom 
        and security. It can be said that their division was practical in the 
        circumstances of their time because the geo-political reality they faced 
        in the early age of Islam from the surrounding mighty empires, their overall 
        concept of the world could not have been much different than this bi-polarity. 
        Moreover as described by Dr. Tariq Ramadan the division was necessary 
        for at least two reasons: &#8220;first, by marking out the Islamic territories, 
        the scholars were able to point out what the essential conditions making 
        a space or a nation Islamic were and what the rulings determining the 
        political and strategic relations with other nations or empire were. Second, 
        it allowed them to establish a clear distinction, as regard legal issues, 
        between the situation of Muslims living inside the Islamic world and those 
        living abroad or those who traveled often such as traders (and who thus 
        required specific ruling)&#8221; [To be a European Muslim by Dr. Teri 
        Ramadan, pp-123, 124]<br>
        <br>
        Apart from these two, another term, dar al-ahd alternatively called dar 
        al-sulh (the abode of treaty), was coined by ash-Shafii to indicate non-Muslim 
        territories involved in treaty agreement giving sovereignty to a Muslim 
        state but maintaining local autonomy. [Toward an Islamic Theory of International 
        Relations, by Dr. Abdul Hamid Abu Sulayman, pp-20]<br>
        <br>
        Another term, dar al-aman (the abode of security), was also there in the 
        classical fiqh which seems very near to dar al-ahd. Dar al-aman refers 
        to the states of security and peace with which Muslims had no belligerent 
        relation.<br>
        <br>
        About this classification of the world the following observations can 
        be made:<br>
        <br>
        1. The concept of dar al-Islam, dar al-harb and dar al-ahd cannot be found 
        either in the Quran or in the Sunnah. Dr Tariq Ramadan writes: &#8220; 
        In fact they were a human attempt, historically dated, to describe the 
        world and to provide the Muslim community with a gauge to measure the 
        world by adapted to their reality. So it is not at all obligatory for 
        us to uphold these concepts.&#8221;[To be a European Muslim by Dr. Tariq 
        Ramadan, pp-130]<br>
        <br>
        2. There was disagreement among classical jurists about the specific parameters 
        that define a dar (abode). Some scholars gave emphasis to government whereas 
        others emphasized on population. Some other scholars (of Hanafi school, 
        like Sarakhsi) considered the question of security and protection prior 
        to considering nature of law and government. This causes a divergence 
        of opinion among contemporary scholars too. In a Fiqh seminar in 1992 
        held in Paris , the scholars took various positions in defining the countries 
        that can be called as dar al-Islam in the current world. Those who refer 
        to population are of the opinion that Muslim countries are still to be 
        considered as dar al-Islam, whereas others state that, countries with 
        government, which clearly do not respect Islamic teachings, cannot be 
        called dar al-Islam any longer. On the other hand, Dr. Tariq Ramadan shows 
        that if one takes into account the parameters considered by some scholars 
        of Hanafi school, i.e. those based on safety and security, one may conclude 
        that the appellation dar al-Islam is applicable to almost all western 
        nations where Muslims are sometimes safer regarding the free practice 
        of their religion rather than many Muslim countries with strict dictators. 
        But this type of conclusion cannot at all said to be correct. The reason 
        behind these conceptual confusions and erroneous conclusion is that we 
        are trying to apply old concepts, which seems far removed from our own 
        time. It is not at all methodologically correct to apply old concepts, 
        which do not fit to contemporary reality. [To be a European Muslim by 
        Dr. Tariq Ramadan, pp-125-127]<br>
        <br>
        3. The concept of dar al-ahd may seem to be useful and suitable to the 
        current reality of the world. But Dr. Tariq Ramadan writes: &#8220;Even 
        the third concept (abode of treaty or dar al-ahd) introduced by ash-Shafii 
        is not sufficient to draw us out of the binary vision of the world. This 
        appellation brings to fore that some countries whilst not Islamic from 
        a political point of view, have nonetheless signed peace or collaboration 
        treaties with one or more Islamic countries.&#8221; So it can be said 
        that the concept of dar al-ahd is related to two other concepts (i.e. 
        dar al-Islam and dar al-harb), i.e. to involve in a agreement we have 
        to know the nature of the two parties involving in the agreement, which 
        again leads to the confusing concept of dar al-Islam and dar al-harb. 
        [Ibid, pp-127, 128]<br>
        <br>
        4. Dr. Ramadan writes: &#8220;It is an era of diversity and complexity 
        and mix which can no longer be encapsulated into a twofold and simplistic 
        vision. &#8230;&#8230; Today we are witnessing a strong current of globalization; 
        it is difficult to refer to the notion of dar (abode) unless we consider 
        the whole world as an abode. Our world has become a small village and, 
        as such, it is, henceforth, an open world.&#8221; [Ibid, p-130, 147]<br>
        <br>
        5. Dr. Ramadan writes: &#8220;Muslim population are now scattered all 
        over the world. Migration has been important and, in spite of most restrictive 
        regulations, it seems that population movement are to continue: by now 
        millions of Muslims have settled in the West. Their fate is linked to 
        that of the society they live in, and it is unthinkable to draw a line 
        of demarcation between them and the &#8220;non-Muslims&#8221; on the sole 
        considerations of space.&#8221;[Ibid, p-148]<br>
        <br>
        6. Dr. Ramadan writes: &#8220;In our world it is no longer a matter of 
        relations between two distinct &#8220;abodes&#8221;. It is rather a question 
        of relations between human beings belonging and referring to different 
        civilizations, religions, cultures and ethics. It is also a question of 
        relations between citizens, in continuous interaction with the social, 
        legal, economic or political framework, which structures and directs the 
        space they live in. This complex process, which is a feature of globalization, 
        over-rides the factors which previously made it possible to define the 
        different &#8220;abodes&#8221;.&#8221;[Ibid, pp-148]<br>
        <br>
        7. Dr. Ramadan writes: &#8220;The old binary geographical representation, 
        with two juxtaposed worlds which would be face to face, in relative balance, 
        no longer has anything to do with the reality of hegemony and areas of 
        influence regarding civilization, culture, economy and subsequently of 
        course politics. Westernization, the legitimate daughter of pluridimensional 
        globalization, can be far better expressed through the notion of centre 
        (the West and its relay capitals in the South) and periphery (the rest 
        of the planet), than by the representation of two &#8220;abodes&#8221; 
        living the reality of a &#8220;con-frontation&#8221;.&#8221; [Ibid, pp-148] 
        <br>
        <br>
        8. The prophet said that entire world is a mosque and pure. So wherever 
        a Muslim, says shahada and is able to perform religious duties in freedom 
        and security, he/she is at home. Dr. Ramadan says that reformist scholars 
        and thinkers like al-Afghani, Abduh, Iqbal and al-Banna were also in support 
        of this opinion. This opinion can be taken as a ground for taking a new 
        look at the world to meet the current reality. [Ibid, pp-144]<br>
        <br>
        9. Dr. Taha Zabir Al Alwani opined that this division of world into immutable 
        regions of war and peace diminishes the possibility of a genuine civilizational 
        dialogue. [&#8220;Globalization: Centralization not Globalize&#8221;, 
        The American Journal of Islamic Social Sciences, IIIT, US, Vol. 15, No. 
        3, Fall 1998, p vii]<br>
        Truly those terms always tend to refer to a state of conflict or at least 
        to a temporary banishment of conflict (by treaty) which not all facilitate 
        dialogue between civilizations. <br>
        <br>
        From the observations above it is quite evident that old concept does 
        not fit our reality. The world has taken into a new shape, which has led 
        the contemporary scholars to reconsider the issue in accordance with the 
        new reality. But there is no consensus among the scholars in identifying 
        and defining the present the world.<br>
        <br>
        Some minority scholars uphold the traditional division. On the other hand 
        the great majority of scholars use the term dar al-ahd and dar al-Islam. 
        Dr. Tariq Rmadan writes: &#8220;The majority scholars use the Shafii concept 
        of dar al-ahd (the abode of treaty) or dar al-amn (the abode of security) 
        in defining the Western countries, stating that these are the most appropriate 
        terms to define our current situation when we are witnessing treaties 
        between nations (directly or through the United Nations) and the fact 
        that fundamental Muslim rights are protected in these Western countries. 
        However, they continue to consider those countries where Muslims are majority 
        as dar al-Islam even if their governments are illegitimate and dictatorial 
        l and even if Islamic teachings and rulings are neglected.&#8221; They 
        hold that those countries should be considered as dar al-Islam with a 
        hope of reform. This opinion is supported by numerous scholars like well-known 
        Dr. Yusuf al-Qardawi, Mustafa az-Zarqa, Abdul Fattah Abu Ghuddah. [Ibid, 
        pp-141, 142] <br>
        <br>
        But some other scholars are interested to use completely new terms. For 
        example Faysal Mawlawi writes: &#8220;We are not, in the West, in the 
        abode of war but we are either in the abode of treaty or in the abode 
        of dawah to God. If we want to keep the (traditional) fiqh classification 
        of the world with the abode of Islam, the abode of War, and the abode 
        of treaty, thus, we are in the West, in the abode of treaty. If, on the 
        other hand, we state that old fiqh classification is no longer applicable 
        to our current situation &#8211; and this is the opinion we prefer &#8211; 
        then we say based on this, that we are in dar ad-dawah as the Prophet 
        and the Muslims were in Makkah before the Hijra. Makkah was neither dar 
        al-Islam nor dar al-harb but a dar ad-dawah and the entire Arabian Peninsula 
        was, in the eyes of Muslims, dar ad-dawah.&#8221; [Quoted by Dr. Tariq 
        Ramadan in &#8220;To be a European Muslim&#8221;, pp-143]<br>
        <br>
        Dr. Taha Jabir al Alwani suggested to move us away from the traditional 
        division of the world into three separate realms of peace (dar al-Islam), 
        war (dar al-harb) and treaty (dar al-sulh). He said, &#8220; Instead, 
        we must identify with Fakhr al Din al Razi, who divided the world into 
        two realms: dar al-ijabah (the land of acceptance, where people accepted 
        Islam and Islamic values are practiced) and dar al-dawah (the land of 
        invitation, to which dawah is presented and its people are invited to 
        Islamic values and practices). This view of the world removes the potential 
        for conflict and emphasizes the role and possibilities of cooperation, 
        understanding, and dialogue.&#8221; [&#8220;Globalization: Centralization 
        not Globalism&#8221;, The American Journal of Islamic Social Sciences, 
        IIIT, US, Vol. 15, No. 3, Fall 1998, p vii]<br>
        <br>
        Dr. Tariq Ramadan used another term dar ash-shahada in defining the Western 
        countries. He writes: &#8220; Called dar ash-shahada, space of testimony, 
        Western countries represent an environment within which Muslims are sent 
        back to the essential teachings of Islam and promoted to ponder over their 
        role: considering themselves as shuhada alan-nas (witnesses before mankind), 
        as the Quran puts it, should lead them to avoid the reactive and overcautious 
        attitude and to develop a feeling of self-confidence, based on a deep 
        sense of responsibility.&#8221; [To be a European Muslim, by Dr. Tariq 
        Ramadan, pp-149, 150]<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        All these modern contributions are useful and represents progress of realistic 
        thought by Muslim scholars in the field of International Relations ( As 
        &#8211;Siyar ). The classification &#8220;Darul Ahad - Darul Islam &#8220; 
        ( for Muslim and Non- Muslim countries ) or the classification &#8220; 
        Darul Ijaba- Darud Dawah &#8220; or &#8220; Darul Islam- Darush- Shahada 
        &#8220; are acceptable in the Islamic and present day perspectives. However, 
        I find the terms Darud Dawah or Darush Shahade relate to one function 
        only of Muslim citizens in Non- Muslim countries , they do not express 
        the status of the state in a comprehensive sense , these terms do not 
        explain fully how the state deals with all kinds of citizens including 
        religious minorities . I, therefore , propose the following classification 
        which takes into consideration the spirit of all the recent conceptualisations 
        in the field but also expreeses the status of the states, Muslim and Non- 
        Muslim, in a comprehensive way. I have not used the word DAR and it is 
        not necessary that we have to use this word.<br>
      <p align="center"> <br>
        <strong>Proposed Classification</strong><br>
      <p>1. Muslim states which accept Islam as basis of their policy and also 
        ensure civil, political and human rights ( including religious rights 
        ) of all citizens</p>
      <p>2. Muslim states which do not acknowledge Islam as basis of their policy 
        and Muslim states which do not fully ensure human rights ( including religious 
        rights )of all citizens,</p>
      <p> 3 .Non-Muslim states who grant human rights ( including religious rights 
        ) to Muslims and other minorities, <br>
      </p>
      <p>4. Non- Muslim states who do not fully grant the human rights (including 
        religious rights ) to Muslims and other minorities.</p>
      <p>In a just international order in the light of Islam ,States in the 2nd 
        category (Muslim states which do not acknowledge Islam as basis of their 
        policy and do not ensure human and religious rights of all citizens) and 
        4th category (Non- Muslim states who do not guarantee the human and religious 
        rights to Muslims and other minorities.) have to be asked ( through the 
        UN system and requirements of international and multilateral protocols 
        and conventions ) to comply with human and religious rights of all citizens. 
        Any action against defaulting state has to be taken only under the international 
        system.I consider the above as Islamic and Just </p>
