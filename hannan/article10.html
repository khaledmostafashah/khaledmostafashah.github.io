      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Before I discuss about the 
      problems and prospects of Islamic Banking, I am discussing some primary 
      issues&nbsp; such as definition, objective and history of modern Islamic 
      banking.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b><u>
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Definition:</span></u></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">An Islamic Banking is a 
      financial institution that operates with the objective to implement and 
      materialise the economic and financial principles of Islam in the banking 
      arena.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">The Organisation of Islamic 
      conference (OIC) defined an Islamic Bank as “ a financial institution 
      whose statutes, rules and procedures expressly state its commitment to the 
      principles of Islamic Shariah and to the banning of the receipt and 
      payment of interest on any of its operations.” </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">According to Islami Banking Act 
      1983 of Malaysia, an Islamic Bank is a “company which carries on Islamic 
      Banking business....... Islamic Banking business means banking business 
      whose aims and operations do not involve any element which is not approved 
      by the religion Islam.” </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b><u>
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Objectives</span></u></b><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">:</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">The objective of Islamic 
      Banking is not only to earn profit, but to do good and bring welfare to 
      the people, Islam upholds the concept that money, income and property 
      belong to Allah and this wealth is to be used for the good of the society.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Islamic Banks operate on 
      Islamic principles of profit and loss sharing and other approved modes of 
      Investment. It strictly avoids interest which is the root of all 
      exploitation and is responsible for large scale inflation and 
      unemployment.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align:justify">
      <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">
      An Islamic Bank is committed to do away with disparity and establish 
      justice in the economy, trade, commerce and industry; build socio-economic 
      infrastructure and create employment opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">The History of Islamic Banking 
      :</span></u></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">The History of Islamic Banking 
      could be divided in to two parts. <b><u>First</u></b> When it still 
      remained an Idea, <b><u>Second</u></b>-When it become a reality-by private 
      initiative in some counties and by law in others.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b><u>
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Islamic Banking as an Idea :</span></u></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">The scholar of the recent past 
      in early fifties started writing for Islamic Banking in place of Interest 
      Free Banking. In the next two decades Islamic Banking attracted more 
      attention.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Early seventies saw the 
      institutional involvement. Conference of the Finance Ministers of the 
      Islamic Countries was held. The involvement of institutions and Government 
      led to the application of theory to practice and resulted in the 
      establishment of the Islamic Banks. In this process the <b><u>‘Islamic 
      Development Bank (IDB)’</u></b> was established in 1975.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b><u>
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">The coming into being of 
      Islamic Banks:</span></u></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">The first private Islamic Bank, 
      the ‘<b><u>Dubai Islamic Bank’</u></b> was also set up in 1975 by a group 
      of Muslim businessmen from several countries.&nbsp; Two more private banks were 
      founded in 1977 under the name of ‘<b><u>Faisal Islamic Bank’</u></b> in 
      Egypt and Sudan. In the same year the Kuwaiti Government set up the ‘</span><b><u><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Kuwait 
      Finance House’</span></u></b><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">In the ten years since the 
      establishment of the first private commercial bank in Dubai, more than 50 
      Islamic Banks have come into being. Though nearly all of them are in 
      Muslim countries, there are some in Western Europe as well : in Denmak, 
      Luxembourg, Switzerland and the UK. </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">In most countries the 
      establishment of Islamic banking had been by private initiative and were 
      confined to that bank. In Iran and Pakistan, however, it was by government 
      initiative and covered all banks in the country. The Governments in both 
      these counties took steps in 1981 to introduce Islamic Banking.</span></p>

      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">The&nbsp; value of US Dollars ($), 
      Pound Sterling, Euro and others are not fixed in Bangladesh, they are 
      fluctuating from time to time Most of our imports and exports are made in 
      USD and USD being a strong currency always moves upward and the exporters 
      are in better position than the importer in our country. In Bangladesh 
      Forward Booking is required to check the exchange fluctuation for import 
      of heavy/project Machineries where it take long time say one year or six 
      months to produce the same.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">But due to the restrictions of 
      Shariah we can not cover the risk of Exchange fluctuation by forward 
      contract as Forward Booking is not permitted by Shariah. As per Shariah, 
      currency, transaction is to be made under certain terms and conditions 
      laid down for “sarf” by Shariah, such as spot possession of both the 
      currencies by both the parties which is not available in forward Booking. 
      It is also prohibited to deal in the forward money market even if the 
      purpose is hedging to avoid loss of profit on a particular transaction 
      effected in a currency whose value is expected to be declined.&nbsp; This 
      problem requires a solution by Shariah experts.</span></p>

      Islamic Bank where the exporters immediately after export of the goods 
      approach to the bank for fund before maturity of the bills to meet their

      how and on what mode of investment ? The Bank can not take anything by

      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">4. <u>Unfamiliarity with the 
      Islamic Banking System</u></span></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">The first problem, is that 
      despite the growth of Islamic banks over the last 30 years, many people in 
      the Muslim and non-Muslim world do not understand what Islamic banking 
      actually is. The basic principle is clear, that it is contrary to Islamic 
      law to make money out of money and that wealth should accumulate from 
      trade and ownership of real assets. However, there does not appear to be a 
      single definition of what is or not an Islamic-banking product; or there 
      is not a single definition of Islamic banking. A major issue here is that 
      it is the Shariah Councils or Boards at individual Islamic banks that 
      actually define what is and what is not Islamic banking, and what is and 
      what is not the acceptable way to do business, which in turn can 
      complicate assessment of risk for both the bank and its customer. More 
      generally, the uncertainty over what is, or is not, an Islamic product has 
      so far prevented standardization. This is difficult for regulators as they 
      like to know exactly what it is they are authorising. It is also an added 
      burden on the banks that have to educate customers in new markets.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">5. <u>Portfolio Management :</u></span></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">The behavior of economic agents 
      in any country is determined partly by past experience and present 
      constraints. The Islamic banks are still growing in experience in many 
      countries. Regarding constraints, Islamic banks in different countries do 
      not freely choose arrangements, which best suit, their need. As a result, 
      their activities are not demand-oriented and do not react flexibly to 
      structural shifts in the economic setting as well as to changes in 
      preferences It is known to the bank management that a certain portion of 
      the short-term fund is normally not withdrawn at maturity; these funds are 
      used for medium or long-term financing. However, a precondition for this 
      maturity transformation is that the bank be able to obtain liquidity from 
      external sources in case or unexpected withdrawals. Islamic banks, without 
      having an interest-free Islamic money and capital market, have no adequate 
      instruments to meet this pre-condition for effective maturity 
      transformation. On the other hand, Islamic banks can enhance term 
      transformation if there is an interest-free bond market or a secondary 
      market for Islamic financial papers. Adequate financial mechanism still 
      has to be developed, without which financial intermediation, especially 
      the risk and maturity transformation, is not performed properly.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">6. <u>The Regulatory 
      environment&nbsp;&nbsp; </u></span></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">The relationship between 
      Islamic banks and monetary authorities is a delicate one. The central bank 
      exercises authority over Islamic banks under laws and regulations 
      engineered to control and supervise both traditional banks. Whatever the 
      goals and functions are, Islamic banks came into existence in an 
      environment where the laws, institutions training and attitude are set to 
      serve an economy based on the principles of interest. The operations of 
      Islamic banks are on a profit and loss share basis (PLS), which actually 
      do not come fully under the jurisdiction of the existing civil laws. If 
      there are disputes to be handled, civil courts are not sufficiently 
      acquainted with the rationale of the operations of Islamic Banking. 
      Regarding the protection of depositors, Islamic Banks are required to let 
      the authorities know the difference between money paid into current 
      accounts and money paid into investment accounts. Islamic banks operate 
      two broad types of deposits:</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: 72.35pt">
      <font face="Times New Roman">a)</font><span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Deposits, which cover 
      transaction balance. These have a 100 percent reserve requirement and 
      completely safe, thus satisfying the needs of risk averters, and </span>

      </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">The PLS or equity 
      account, in which depositors are treated exactly as if they&nbsp; were 
      shareholders in the bank. There is no guaranteed rate of return or 
      nominal&nbsp; value of the share.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">In non-Muslim counties (i.e., 
      the countries with less than 50% Muslim population) the central banks are 
      very stringent in granting licenses for Islamic banks to operate. In order 
      to be established in those countries Islamic banks must also meet the 
      additional requirements of other government and non-government 
      authorities. (So, apart from legal constraints there are economic measures 
      that result operations of Islamic banks in the non-Muslim world 
      difficult). In Muslim countries also they face economic restrictions. 
      Besides funding, acceptable investment outlets is a major challenge for 
      Islamic financial institutions.</span></p>

      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">7. <u>Absence of Liquidity 
      Instruments</u></span></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Many Islamic banks lack 
      liquidity instruments such as treasury bills and other marketable 
      securities, which could be utilised either to cover liquidity shortages or 
      to manage excess liquidity. This problem is aggravated since many Islamic 
      banks work under operational procedures different from those of the 
      central banks; the resulting non-compatibility prevents the central banks 
      from controlling or giving support to Islamic banks if a liquidity gap 
      should occur. So the issue of liquidity management must come under active 
      discussion and scrutiny by the authorities involved is Islamic banking.</span></p>

      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">8. <u>Use of Advanced 
      Technology and Media</u></span></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Many Islamic banks do not have 
      the diversity of products essential to satisfy the growing need of their 
      clients. The importance of using proper advanced technology in upgrading 
      the acceptability of a product and diversifying its application cannot be 
      over emphasized. Given the potentiality of advanced technology, Islamic 
      banks must have to come to terms with rapid changes in technology, and 
      redesign the management and decision-making structures and, above, all 
      introduce modern technology in its operations. Many Islamic banks also 
      lack the necessary expertise and institutional capacity for Research and 
      Development (R &amp; D) that is not only necessary for the realization of 
      their full potential, but also for its very survival in this age of fierce 
      competition, sophisticated markets and an informed public. Islamic banking 
      cannot but stagnate and wither without dynamic and ongoing programmes. In 
      addition, Islamic banks have so far not used the media appropriately.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Even the Muslims are not very 
      much aware that the Islamic banking is being practiced in the world. 
      Islamic banks have not ever used an effective media to publicise their 
      activities. The authorities concerned in Islamic banks should address 
      these issues on a priority basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="text-align:justify">
      <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">The need for 
      professional bankers or managers for Islamic banks cannot be over 
      emphasized. Some banks are currently run by direct involvement of the 
      owner himself, or by managers who have not had much exposure to Islamic 
      banking activities, nor are conversant with conventional banking methods. 
      Consequently, many Islamic banks are not able to face challenges and stiff 
      competition. There is a need to institute professionalism in banking 
      practice to enhance management capacity by competent bankers committed to 
      their profession. Because, the professionals working in Islamic banking 
      system have to face bigger challenge, as they must have a better 
      understanding of industry, technology and the management of the business 
      venture they entrust to their clients. They also have to understand the 
      moral and religious implications of their investments with the business 
      ventures. There is also a need for banking professionals to be properly 
      trained in Islamic banking and finance. Most bank’s professionals have 
      been trained in conventional economics. They lack the requisite vision and 
      conviction about the efficiency of the Islamic banking.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

      <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">Bankers, due 
      to the nature of their jobs have to be pragmatic or application-oriented. 
      There is and will be tendency in the bankers practicing in Islamic banks 
      to mould or modify the Islamic principles to suit the requirement for 
      transactions at hand. Additionally, being immersed in the travails of day 
      to day banking, they find little time or inclination to do any research, 
      which can make any substantial contribution to the Islamic banking. 
      Islamic Scholars active in researching Islamic Banking and finance, on the 
      other hand, typically have a normative approach, i.e. they are more 
      concerned with what ought to be. A very few of them are knowledgeable 
      about banking or the needs of the customers. </span></p>

      Absence of Islamic Money Market</u></span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="text-align:justify">
      <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">In the 
      absence of Islamic money market in Bangladesh, the Islamic banks cannot 
      invest their surplus fund i.e., temporary excess liquidity to earn any 
      income rather than keeping it idle. Because all the Government Treasury 
      Bills, approved securities and Bangladesh Bank Bills in Bangladesh are 
      interest bearing. Naturally, the Islamic banks cannot invest the 
      permissible part of their Security Liquidity Reserve and liquid surplus in 
      those securities. As a result, they deposit their whole reserve in cash 
      with Bangladesh Bank. Similarly, the liquid surplus also remains 
      uninvested. On the contrary, the conventional banks of the country do not 
      suffer from this sort of limitations. As such, the profitability of the 
      Islamic banks in Bangladesh is adversely affected.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align:justify">
      <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">
      The absence of suitable long term assets available to Islamic banks is 
      mirrored by lack of short term tradable financial instruments. At present 
      there is no equivalent of an inter-bank market in Bangladesh where banks 
      could place, say, over night funds, or where they could borrow to satisfy 
      temporary liquidity needs. Trading of financial instruments is also 
      difficult to arrange when rates of return are not know until maturity. 
      Furthermore, it is not clear whether Islamic banks in Bangladesh can 
      utilise more exotic instruments, such as derivatives, that are becoming 
      increasingly popular with conventional banks. Obviously, these factors 
      place Islamic banking in Bangladesh at a distinct disadvantage compared to 
      its conventional banking counterpart.</span></p>

      Any system, however well integrated it may be, cannot thrive exclusively 
      on its built-in elements. It has to depend on a number of link 
      institutions and so is the case with Islamic banking. For identifying 
      suitable projects, Islamic banking can profitably draw the services of 
      economists, lawyers, insurance companies, management consultants, auditors 
      and so on. They also need research and training forums in order to 
      prompting entrepreneurship amongst their clients. Such support services 
      properly oriented towards Islamic banking are yet to be developed in 
      Bangladesh.</span></p>

      Another important issue facing Islamic banks in Bangladesh is how to 
      organise their relationships with foreign banks, and more generally, how 
      to conduct international operations. This is, of course, an issue closely

      simultaneously consistent with Islamic principles and acceptable to 
      interest-based banks, including foreign banks.</span></p>

      Islamic Banks stick very closely to the pricing policies of the 
      government. They can not benefit from hidden costs and inputs, which 
      elevate the level of prices by certain entrepreneurs without any 
      justification. On the other hand, Islamic banks as financial institutions 
      are even more directly affected by the failure of the projects they 
      finance. This is because the built in security for getting back their 
      funds, together with their profits, is in the success of the project. 
      Islamically, it is not lawful to obtain security from the partner against 
      dishonesty or negligence, both of which are very difficult if not 
      impossible to prove.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">In my understanding the 
      prospect of Islamic Banking is very bright.&nbsp; Muslim people everywhere want 
      Islamic Banking.&nbsp; In Bangladesh, to give an example,&nbsp; 4/5 conventional 
      Banks have opened separate Islamic branches recently.&nbsp; Five hundred 
      applications are pending with Islamic Bank Bangladesh Ltd. for opening of 
      new braches.&nbsp; IBBL has already 132 branches in the country.&nbsp; </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">The position may not be same in 
      all countries.&nbsp; But if Islamic Banking succeeds in any country, the 
      position will same in every Muslim country in my judgment.&nbsp; This means, 
      that first Islamic Bank in any country should be well managed and 
      successful so that people have faith in this system.&nbsp; Established Islamic 
      Banks should co-operate by lending competent officials in setting up new 
      Islamic Banks.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">The 
      problems mentioned in the preceding pages are not insurmountable.&nbsp; Most of 
      them can be solved with more research and dedicated efforts.&nbsp; IDB, OIC 
      Fiqh Academy, Internatinal Islamic Banking organizations and individual 
      Islamic banks should put more resources in research in Islamic Banking, 
      Finance and Economic issues. Cooperation of Central Banks and the 
      Governments. will be needed in some areas.&nbsp; I have no doubt in mind that 
      Islamic banking will expand more and more in the entire world.</span></td>
