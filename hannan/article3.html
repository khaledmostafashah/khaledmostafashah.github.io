      <p align="justify">Democracy is a commonly known word all over the world. 
      Most of the political movements in the world have made it their goal to 
      establish this system in their respective countries. Democracy is the most 
      popular and accepted political system in the modern world. Yet, there 
      exists some difference of opinion among the Islamic groups on democracy. 
      Democracy and human rights have occupied very important position in the 
      political agenda of many of the Islamic parties. However, some of the 
      parties and people do not accept it, since democracy speaks of sovereignty 
      of the people. <br>
      <br>
      In this context, we need a careful and deep analysis of this issue. We 
      need to understand the issue avoiding the minor technicalities. As we see, 
      Islamic parties and Islamic scholars of the modern world think of a 
      political system wherein government will run the country through 
      Parliament. They also want freedom of expression, voting right of the 
      people, rule of law, independent &amp; free judiciary, free press, fundamental 
      human rights etc. These are also the pre-requisites of the democratic 
      system. It is therefore, apparent on a deeper analysis that the concept of 
      state and govt. of Islamic Parties are in conformity with the principles 
      of democracy.<br>
      <br>
      Theoretically speaking, Islam speaks of sovereignty of Allah, while 
      western democracy advocates that sovereignty belongs to people. However, 
      all political thinkers do not share the same view of sovereignty. Some 
      political scientists even argue that there is no need of the concept 
      sovereignty at all. Even the concept of sovereignty is not highlighted in 
      the books which discuss democracy though sovereignty is discussed in great 
      detail as a political concept in the books of political science. <br>
      <br>
      In this connection position taken in the constitution of Islamic Republic 
      of Iran is very relevant. Heading of chapter 5 of the consititution is 
      “Sovereignty of the Nation and the Powers emanating there from”. Article 
      56 reads as follows:<br>
      <br>
      “The absolute sovereignty over the universe and man belongs to God who has 
      bestowed upon man sovereignty over his social destiny. None can deprive 
      man of this sovereignty, nor can he place it in the interest of certain 
      other person or group of persons. The nation shall exercise this divine 
      sovereignty through the ways referred to in the following articles of Law”<br>
      <br>
      It is apparent that sovereignty has been divided between “absolute 
      Soverignty” and “bestowed Soverignty” (like concepts of legal sovereignty 
      and political sovereignty in the western concepts). It is clear from above 
      that all of us need not take same view on the concept and nature of 
      sovereignty.<br>
      <br>
      In this context, we feel it necessary to quote from the writings of Allama 
      Yousuf Al Qardawi, an eminent Islamic scholar of the present time. He 
      wrote on Political Freedom and Democracy as follows:<br>
      <br>
      “ The fear of some people here that democracy makes the people a source of 
      power and even legislation (although legislation is Allah’s alone) should 
      not be heeded here, because we are supposed to be speaking of a people 
      that in its majority has accepted Allah as its Lord, Mohammad as its 
      Prophet and Islam as its Religion. Such a people would not be expected to 
      pass a legislation that contradicts Islam and its incontestable principles 
      and conclusive rules.” <br>
      <br>
      “Anyway, these fears can be overcome by one article stipulating that any 
      legislation contradicting the incontestable provisions of Islam shall be 
      null and void because Islam is the religion of the State and the source of 
      legitimacy of all its institutions and therefore may no be contradicted, 
      as a branch may not run against the main stream.”<br>
      <br>
      “It should be known that the acceptance of the principle that legislation 
      or rule belong to Allah does not rob the Nation of its right to seek for 
      itself the codes necessary to regulate its ever-changing life and earthly 
      affairs.”<br>
      <br>
      “What we seek is that legislations and codes be within the limits of the 
      flawless texts and the over all objectives of Sharia and the Islamic 
      Message. The binding texts are very few, while the area of 
      “permissibility” or legislative free space is quite wide and the texts 
      themselves are so flexible and capacious as to accommodate more than one 
      understanding and accept more than one interpretation, which leads to the 
      existence of several schools and philosophies within the expansive 
      framework of Islam.” (Quoted from ‘Priorities of the Islamic Movement in 
      the Coming Phase’, Chapter : The Movement and political Freedom and 
      Democracy)<br>
      <br>
      We find many Islamic scholars accepted the idea of democracy in Islam 
      though under certain conditions. Dr. Abu Said Nuruddin has written in his 
      book ‘Mohakobi Iqbal’, ( Iqbal the Great Poet) that Allama Iqbal, was not 
      happy with the democratic system because of its secularist stance but he 
      suggested in his writings that there was no alternative to democracy. In 
      his 6th speech on ‘Reconstruction of religious thought in Islam’, Allama 
      Iqbal stated that Islamic state is established on the principles of 
      freedom, equality, and the absolute principles of stability. Therefore the 
      principles of democratic rule is not only similar with the fundamental 
      aspects of Islam rather the executing powers are enhanced in the Muslim 
      world (Mohakabi Iqbal, Iqbal the Great Poet by Dr. Abu Said Nuruddin)<br>
      <br>
      Iqbal observed, should the foundation of democracy rest upon spiritual and 
      moral values, it would be the best political system. He wrote in the &quot;The 
      New Era&quot; on its 28th July, 1917 issue: that democracy was born in Europe 
      from economic renaissance that took place in most of its societies…….But 
      Islamic democracy is not developed from the idea of economic advancement 
      rather it is a spiritual principle that comes from the principle that 
      everybody is a source of power whose possibilities can be developed 
      through virtue and character”. [Mohakabi Iqbal ( Iqbal the Great Poet) by 
      Dr. Abu Said Nuruddin, page -239) <br>
      <br>
      That means according to Iqbal Islam prescribes democracy under the law of 
      Allah.<br>
      <br>
      We see Moulana Maududi, fifty years ago from now, in his book “Political 
      theory of Islam” used the term “Theo-democracy” for Islamic state. He 
      didn’t deny the term ‘democracy’. Rather he accepted democracy while this 
      system will work under the sovereignty of Allah. <br>
      <br>
      There is a misconception about Moulana Maududi’s true position about 
      democracy. Moulana Maududi initially criticized western democracy because 
      of its secularism and popular sovereignty (in the sense that Parliament 
      can make any law even if it violates the Law of Allah). However, his later 
      writings and political conduct proved that he believed in Democracy (Rule 
      of the people) subject to the Law of Allah (Sovereignty of Allah). <br>
      <br>
      In an interview with Akhbar-e-Jahan Karachi which was published on 2 April 
      1969, Sayyid Maududi said,<br>
      <br>
      “Islam and Democracy are not opposed to each other. Democracy is a system 
      where Govt. is formed run and changed on the basis of public opinion. 
      Islamic political order also is of the same type. However, our democratic 
      values are different from western values. Western democracy has no 
      limits…………………………………………… ……. …………………………... <br>
      On the other hand Islamic democracy is controlled by the Quran and the 
      Sunnah ………… …”<br>
      <br>
      (Interviews of Moulana Maududi, on Bangla translation) published by 
      Adhunik Prokashani, Bangla Bazar, Dhaka, 1st edition. 1999, page 263).<br>
      <br>
      In an interview with Mujallatun Guraba, an Arabic paper from London 
      (published in February 1969 No.), he said, “ to make people understand now 
      it is essential to use modern terminology. But care should be taken in 
      their use. Same terms should be avoided such as socialism. Some terms are 
      permitted with the condition that their Islamic and western connotation 
      should be clearly spelled out. Democracy, Constitutional system and 
      parliamentary system are such terms …….”. (ibid, page 255).<br>
      <br>
      In an interview published in the Daily Mashriq of Lahore, Pakistan (1st 
      February, 1970), in reply to a question he said that, “those are good 
      people in his view who want to establish democracy in the country”. (ibid, 
      pages 339-345). <br>
      <br>
      He has said in the same interview that “all our constitutional problems 
      should be solved by the representative of the people”.<br>
      <br>
      In another interview in the Daily Hurriat in 1969 (published on 10th 
      November), he again said that all constitutional amendments should be made 
      in a democratic way by the representatives of the people”. (ibid, P-313).<br>
      <br>
      His party always supported democracy. Pakistan constitution in 1956 and in 
      1973 was modeled structurally on democracy and his party Jamaat-e-Islami 
      supported these. His party fought against Martial Laws in Pakistan. He 
      supported Fatima Jinnah against Ayub Khan in Presidential election in 1965 
      because she promised to restore democracy. His party was a component of 
      DAC (Political combination of parties), where “D” stands for democracy.<br>
      <br>
      So it is evident from his later writings and political conduct that he 
      stood for democracy.<br>
      <br>
      We also see that in the first Islamic constitution of the present world, 
      the term democracy was accepted with the consent of Islamic scholars (ulema). 
      In the preamble, the term democracy was accepted in the following manner :<br>
      <br>
      “Wherein the principles of democracy freedom, equality, tolerance and 
      social justice, as enunciated by Islam, should be fully observed”. (from 
      the preamble of the constitution Pakistan of 1956)<br>
      <br>
      In the 1973 constitution of Pakistan the same position was maintained.<br>
      <br>
      “Wherein the principles of democracy freedom, equality, tolerance and 
      social justice, as enunciated by Islam, shall be fully observed”. (from 
      the preamble of the constitution of 1973)<br>
      <br>
      This means that democracy has been accepted within the limits of Islam so 
      that in the name of democracy Islamic principles cannot be violated. 
      Islamic Scholars and Islamic Politicians have come to accept the word 
      democracy and what it means within these limits. <br>
      <br>
      Allama Yousuf Al Qardawi in his book “ Priorities of the Islamic Movement 
      In the Coming Phase” has titled one of its chapters as “ The Movement and 
      Political Freedom and Democracy”. In this book he has shown that Islam 
      does not allow any kind of autocracy or monarchy. He also showed that 
      Islam spreads through political freedom. He stated that Islam unlike 
      democracy is a complete code of life, which encompasses many more vital 
      issues of human needs. Above all, he thinks democracy is consistent with 
      Islam and the fundamental rights of mankind prescribed in Islam can be 
      ensured through democracy. He has advocated in favor of democratic system 
      and political freedom. But he suggested to introduce a clause in the 
      constitution to the effect that no law will be passed contrary to the 
      injunctions of the Quran and Sunnah. This clause will act as guarantee 
      against the fear of some people that anti Islamic law may be passed under 
      the cover of democracy. Dr. Qardawi writes:<br>
      <br>
      “ It is the duty of the ( Islamic) Movement in the coming phase to stand 
      firm against totalitarian and dictatorial rule, political despotism and 
      usurpation of people’s rights. The movement should always stand by 
      political freedom, as represented by true , not false, democracy. It 
      should flatly declare its refusal of tyrants and steer clear of all 
      dictators, even if some tyrant appears to have good intentions towards it 
      for some gain and for a time that is usually short, as has been shown by 
      experience.<br>
      <br>
      The Prophet (SAWS) said , “ When you see my Nation fall victim to fear and 
      does not say to wrong-doer , “ You are wrong”, then you may lose hope in 
      them. “ So how about a regime that forces people to say to a conceited 
      wrongdoer, “ How just, how great you are. O our hero, our savior and our 
      liberator!”<br>
      <br>
      The Quran denounces tyrants such as Nimrudh, Pharoah, Haman and others, 
      but it also dispraises those who follow tyrants and obey their orders. 
      This is why Allah dispraises the people of Noah by saying, “ But they 
      follow (men) whose wealth and children give them no increase but only 
      loss.” [Surat Nuh : 21] <br>
      <br>
      Allah also says of Ad, people of Hud, “ And followed the command of every 
      powerful, obstinate transgressor”.[ Sura HUD : 59]<br>
      <br>
      See also what the Quran says about the people of Pharoah, “ But they 
      followed the command of Pharaoh, and the command of Pharoah was not 
      rightly guided.[ Surat Hud : 97] “ Thus he made fools of his people, and 
      they obeyed him : truly they were a people rebellious (against Allah) .” [ 
      Sura Az- Zukhruf : 54]<br>
      <br>
      A closer look at the history of the Muslim Nation and the Islamic Movement 
      in modern times should show clearly that the Islamic idea, the Islamic 
      Movement and the Islamic Awakening have never flourished or borne fruit 
      unless in an atmosphere of democracy and freedom, and have withered and 
      become barren only at the times of oppression and tyranny that trod over 
      the will of the people by force which clung to Islam. Such oppressive 
      regimes imposed their Secularism, Socialism, or Communism on their people 
      by force and coercion, using covert torture and public executions, and 
      employing those devilish tools that tore flesh, shed blood, crushed bone 
      and destroyed the soul.<br>
      <br>
      On the other hand, we saw the Islamic Movement and the Islamic Awakening 
      bear fruit and flourish at the times of freedom and democracy, and in the 
      wake of the collapse of imperial regimes that ruled peoples with fear and 
      oppression.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, I would not imagine that the Islamic Movement could support 
      anything other than political freedom and democracy.”<br>
      <br>
      “ However, the tools and guarantees created by democracy are as close as 
      can ever be to the realization of the political principles brought to this 
      earth by Islam to put a leash on the ambitions and whims of rulers. These 
      principles are: shura (consultation), good advice enjoining what is proper 
      and forbidding what is evil, disobeying illegal orders, resisting unbelief 
      and changing wrong by force whenever possible. It is only in democracy and 
      political freedom that the power of Parliament is evident and that 
      people’s deputies can withdraw confidence from any government that 
      breaches the Constitution, and it is only in such an environment that the 
      strength of free press, free Parliament, opposition and the masses is most 
      felt.” <br>
      (Quoted from ‘Priorities of the Islamic Movement in the Coming Phase’, 
      Chapter : The movement and political Freedom and Democracy)<br>
      <br>
      It is evident from the above discussion that Islamic thinkers and Muslim 
      people want their right to vote, rule of law, and a government that is to 
      be elected by the people. The term democracy mean all these things. Taking 
      everything into consideration, we can say that there is no problem to 
      accept democracy as a political structure and as a concept of freedom 
      (except its concept of sovereignty). We find that different constitutions 
      and Islamic scholars conditionally accepted the term ‘democracy’. Muslim 
      community can accept this term. This will help to remove misunderstanding 
      about Islam that it is for violence and dictatorship.</td>
