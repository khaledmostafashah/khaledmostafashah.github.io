    <td width="100%"> <p align="justify">Philosophically thinking, the biggest 
        problem of the world is forgetting Allah, the creator; to become indifferent 
        of His existence. Allah subhana wa ta-a-la said, &quot;O Man! what has 
        seduced thee from thy Lord Most Benificent?&quot; (82:6). At present day 
        it is indeed a reality that mankind is negligent of their creator. Atheistic 
        beliefs are predominant in Europe and a major trend in America. Russia 
        had been a self declared atheist nation for long. Even among the believers, 
        many are skeptics. Skeptics don't openly claim that there is no Creator 
        but they are insensitive about the existence of a creator and do not consider 
        remembrance of Him as an important matter. <br>
        <br>
        This is the condition of all communities, even those who believe in God 
        are oblivious of Him in their practical life. In comparison, however, 
        the Muslims are yet less affected by atheism and skepticism. They are 
        more or less practicing believers. Even the Muslims, who consider themselves 
        secular, observe the Islamic rituals to some extent. They too say their 
        prayers, do fasting in the Ramadan, celebrate the Eids and care about 
        the Halal and Haraam. <br>
        <br>
        Forgetfulness of God has basically created two problems: materialism and 
        atheism. The above mentioned two are the fundamental reason of the crisis 
        of the world today. It can be mentioned that hard-core or extreme secularism 
        produce same kind of behaviour as the atheists and skeptics.<br>
        <br>
        The forgetfulness of God has also affected the education system, which 
        is entirely built upon secularism. Present day science is based on secular 
        perception. European scholars and even the Muslim scholars today do not 
        begin their books with &quot;the name of Creator or God&quot;. On the 
        contrary, when the Muslims were making development in science, learning 
        from China and India, they contributed into many branches of sciences. 
        At that time, Muslim scientists used to start every books of science in 
        the name of their Lord. They were sincere believers. But the European 
        scientists, not being believers of God or considering expression of belief 
        to be a humiliating fact, never mentioned the name of the creator. Muslim 
        scientists of today can write it. Unfortunately they are also not doing 
        it these days. Earlier writing the name of God was the custom. Today avoding 
        it has become the custom. <br>
        <br>
        In books of sciences there is no reference to the word Allah or God. The 
        word 'Creator' is not used at all. It is an amazing thing. In some cases, 
        the term 'nature' is used instead of creator, which is very confusing. 
        What is 'nature' is not clear at all. They never think how these natural 
        laws came into existence. How come laws could exist without a lawgiver 
        (creator of the law)? They claim to be the most rational, but I am finding 
        no rationality at all in this point. <br>
        <br>
        The modern science has numerous benefits and uses, we agree to that. But 
        it is driven by a mind that is skeptic on the question of God. A mind 
        that does not recognize God, does not mention God, even considers mentioning 
        God an uncivilized matter. These concepts behind modern scientific thinking 
        are affecting our culture and promoting skepticism and atheism. <br>
        <br>
        Some social sciences maintains similar view in this issue. Sociology assumes 
        that religion is a man-made concept. But they could have promoted the 
        concept that God has created us, and gives us a tendency to be social 
        by giving a social mind. Inclination to communal life of human beings 
        is the design and part of plan of God. That is why we become united and 
        form society. The anthropologists are not admitting that God has created 
        human beings. They completely reject this idea. Anthropology is trying 
        to discover the origin of man by digging into the earth searching for 
        fossils. From those they are saying that human being came into existence 
        spontaneously; there is no Creator. <br>
        <br>
        I would like to mention here that poverty is a big crisis of present day 
        world. A large number of people cannot remain good and honest because 
        of poverty. This crisis is also in the ultimate analysis a product of 
        atheism, secularism and hedonism. Most of the people have become secularist 
        today. It appears that they do not feel the importance of working for 
        the poor and eliminating poverty. Particularly the capitalists of the 
        world don't seem to want this at all. There is no mention of any real 
        concern for the poor in the literature of economics of capitalism. It 
        mentions profit, open market; it talks about non-intervention of the government 
        in financial issues. But it never really solves the problem of market 
        distortion. Capitalism has become an inhuman economic thought in the name 
        of Positivism, the other name of discarding moral principles in the economic 
        field. It never mentions elimination of poverty. Some capitalist nations 
        do take action against poverty but they are doing that by going out of 
        the framework of capitalism, not because this is the demand of capitalist 
        philosophy. <br>
        <br>
        Colonialism and Imperialism are also offshoots of materialism. The inspiration 
        to seek more and more pleasaure for oneself and his nation is the root 
        of these concepts. Exploiting the people for one's own benefit is their 
        purpose. The selfishness and capitalism are not unrelated. All these concepts 
        together have made man irresponsible and have made him hedonist and self-seekers. 
        The responsible people are actually those who fear Allah and do not exploit 
        the world. <br>
        <br>
        Thus, I must say the root of all problems is forgetfulness of the Creator. 
        This is the reason for which our prophets came and told us to obey our 
        Creator. <br>
        <br>
        Thus, the solution of the crisis of the world today is bringing the faith 
        of God back among the people, both the Muslims and non-Muslim. I shall 
        say that believing in any religion is far better than atheism. Because 
        every religion has some ethics. Atheism has no ethics. The atheist thinks 
        himself to be independent and not responsible to any higher Being. 
      <p>He thinks his actions will never be judged, no one will even question 
        about his actions. So, he can do anything in this world. People like this 
        are dangerous for the society. For this reason, faith in God should be 
        reestablished among the people. We have to let people recognize God, as 
        firmly as possible. We have to have moral basis in education. This is 
        how we can eliminate selfishness from the humanity and can solve the root-cause 
        of all problems of the world. Of course, we have to do many other things 
        for peace and progress of humanity.<br>
