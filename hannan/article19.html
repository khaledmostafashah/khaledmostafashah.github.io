      <p align="justify">Moulana Muhamad Akram Khan was among the top four or 
      five top scholars of former Benga in the last few hundred years. He was 
      the president of Bengal Muslim league, a great Islamic scholar and a 
      journalist. Above all, he was a writer and researcher of biography of the 
      prophet (Sm), the Quran, history and literature.<br>
      <br>
      One, who has read his Mustafa Charit a biography of the prophet, can 
      realize how great a researcher he was. He analyzed the life of the prophet 
      in the light of authentic history and accepted only the facts which are 
      really proved. He excluded the materials which are contrary to reason. The 
      criticism raised by western scholars about the prophet has been strongly 
      rebutted. In this context, he considered some traditions relevant to the 
      life of the prophet and examined the text of those traditions. Based on 
      the principles of examining texts of Hadith (Matn), laid down by the 
      jurisprudents (Usuliun), he concluded some of them as unacceptable. 
      Everyone may not agree with him. But his work would make us think and 
      enhance our ability to analyze. <br>
      <br>
      His book The Social history of Muslim Bengal is an unparalleled 
      contribution; very few books are as authentic and analytical as this.<br>
      <br>
      Another extraordinary work of Akram Khan is his translation and 
      interpretation of The Holy Quran, The Tafsirul Quran. Although he used old 
      sophisticated Bengali language used generally by all past major writers 
      (not used now), the translation was lucid and soothing. The language of 
      his translation of the Quran is the best in my judgment. He adopted a very 
      cautious approach and showed his great acumen in using appropriate words. 
      Some examples are as follows:<br>
      <br>
      (1) He has translated the word taqwa in several ways, one of them is 
      restrain (Shangzom in Bangla), for instance in Sura Al-Bakara, Ayat - 21.<br>
      <br>
      (2) He has translated the word fasiq as evil doers ( Duskarmaparayan in 
      Bangla). In my opinion it is a very suitable translation of the word. 
      (Ref: translation of sura Bakara, V:22; Tafsirul Quran, Zhinuk 
      publication, Dhaka, Bangladesh ,volume -1, page - 38)<br>
      <br>
      (3) He has translated the word Asmaa as knowledge of essence of al things 
      or matter (Bostutottoguli in Bangla), which is very exceptional.<br>
      <br>
      He was very cautious about women related issues and mentioned clearly 
      where women have priority. For example he translated the verse: 36 of sura 
      Al Imran Laisal zakaru kal unsa as whereas men are not equal (shamotulla 
      in Bangla) to women. (Ref: ibid, page 395)Those who always refer to Ayat: 
      34 of Sura Nisa, should also take this verse into account. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      In his tafsir he has given very logical explanation of various events. He 
      had faith in miracles of prophets but he didnt accept unauthentic and 
      irrational stories. <br>
      <br>
      The account of Musa fleeing from Egypt with Bani Israel was given a very 
      logical explanation. His main argument was that Musa along with his 
      followers crossed the Nile rather than the Red Sea. The previous Tafsirs 
      were mainly based on Exodus of the Bible and other legends. His arguments 
      about this issue are as follows:<br>
      <br>
      In the first part of the verse under discussion (Sura Bakara, Ayat: 50), 
      the word Al Bahr has been used. ?In dictionary the word Bahr has been 
      defined as:<br>
      <br>
      (1) Large quantity of water, usually saline water. (Kamus)<br>
      <br>
      (2) All streams are Bahr.(Zawhari)<br>
      <br>
      (3) Word opposite to land -- saline water, each big stream, any wide 
      substance.(Mawared)<br>
      <br>
      It is therefore clearly established that Israelites lived somewhere on the 
      bank of Nile, not far away from the royal palace. From that place they 
      were moving to their ancestors land .--- Their destination was Palestine 
      and Jerusalem. After crossing Egyptian border, they arrived in Sinai 
      Peninsula and Tih area. There are many proofs in the Quran in support of 
      this fact.<br>
      <br>
      Then Akram Khan argued that it was very much illogical to reach Arabia 
      crossing 500 miles of sea route and from there to Palestine. The 
      irrationality lies in the fact that they were many in number and didnt 
      have any means of transport. So it was very difficult for them to cover 
      such distance by foot. Instead the easier option for them to reach Sinai 
      was to cross a lake or coastland from Egypt. He further argued that to 
      describe the place where Pharaoh died, the words Bahr and Yam were used. 
      Both of the words can be interpreted as stream or any form of water body. 
      Its merely a description narrated in Exodus of Old Testament that Pharaoh 
      died drowning in the Red Sea. But there is no evidence for this in Quran 
      or authentic Hadith. <br>
      <br>
      Akram Khan said in the conclusion, The area stretching from Mediterranean 
      Sea to Suez city was filled with many lakes and various types of marshes 
      before Suez Canal was dug. The water of this area naturally decreased 
      during ebb tide. Then the relatively higher lands would come above the 
      water level and nearby shallow lands became drier. During high tide the 
      water entered and submerged those places. ? According to Allahs command 
      Prophet Musa started the journey from Egypt at an appropriate time. He was 
      also directed to the right path by Allah. That is why Bani Israelites were 
      saved and Pharaoh died drowning in the sea. In my opinion this is the most 
      important miracle in the life of prophet Musa. (Ref: Tafsirul Quran, 
      Zhinuk publication, volume 1, page 79 - 87) <br>
      <br>
      In his Tafsir he supported the view that there is no abrogated (Mansukh) 
      verse in the Quran. In the commentery of sura Bakara, Ayat:184 &amp;185, he 
      wrote about this issue: The word yutikunahu is used in this verse. I 
      interpreted it as those who can fast with great difficulty. I think it is 
      the proper interpretation. Imam Razi supported this view and Imam Rageb 
      also defined it in the same way in his dictionary. It is a matter of 
      regret that most of the narrators of Tafsir interpreted it as those who 
      dont fast in spite of being capable of fasting-------. Because of this 
      inappropriate translation, a group of modernist scholars of the present 
      days are saying that fast can be broken by paying fidya (feeding poor) 
      even if there is no difficulty. On the other hand, a group of narrators 
      and muffassirin are telling that Ayat:185 was revealed just after 
      revelation of Ayat: 184 abrogating the provision(of Ayat: 184).But we have 
      to remember that this is the speech(Qalam) of Allah. He cannot be such 
      capricious that He will reveal an ayah and immediately there after 
      abrogate it. In fact there is no Mansukh (abrogated) ayat in the 
      Quran.(Tafsirul Quran, commentary under Sura Bakara, Ayat 184,185, page 
      -224,225). <br>
      <br>
      He is giving very rational interpretation of verse 228 of sura Al-Bakara. 
      He writes, It has been further said that husband has the same right over 
      wife as wife has over husband. If both do their duties, family life will 
      be full of happiness. Man has a degree over woman means man has a degree 
      of more responsibility. In Sura Nisa, ayat 34, man has been said kawwam or 
      maintainer. (Tafsirul Quran, note no. 181, Sura Bakara)<br>
      <br>
      He expresses the view that it was not lawful to take female slaves except 
      through marriage. He writes, A section of Alims think that in this ayat no 
      instruction has been given to marry female slaves. They think that female 
      slaves can be used in any manner on the basis of ownership, no marriage is 
      necessary for this. I am declaring with greatest emphasis that this 
      opinion is against the general principals of Islam and the principals laid 
      down in the Quran. This is nothing but an extremely bad opinion. (Ref: 
      Tafsirul Quran, Sura Nisa, note no.7, page 580)<br>
      <br>
      Then Moulana Akram Khan elaborated his opinion in the next two pages where 
      he also gives a long quotation of Imam Razi(Ahkamul Quran,vol-2,page-56).
      <br>
      <br>
      This Tafsir of Maulana Muhammad Akram Khan is an excellent Tafsir. It has 
      similarities with the Tafsir of Muhammad Asad. He can be said to be Asad 
      of the subcontinent in the field of Tafsirt hough they probably did not 
      meet each other.Akram Khan wrote his Tafsir at least 20 years before 
      Muhammad Asad.. His rationalist Tafsir may not be liked by some. However 
      we have to admit that he has not given any opinion in his Tafsir without 
      good reasons. This Tafsir should be reprinted and circulated widely for 
      the benefit of the researchers and the educated people.</td>
