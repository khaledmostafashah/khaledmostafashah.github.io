      <p align="justify">I would discuss the subject in the context of 
      Bangladesh and also in general context. Before I discuss the particular 
      issue that is Public Sector Financing under Islamic framework, I want to 
      discuss about the Fiscal System in Islam in general. Now, by Fiscal system 
      we mean two policies. One is the tax regime of the country or the taxation 
      system of country. The other is the expenditure policy of the country. In 
      other words, how revenue is realized and how revenue is spent. This is the 
      matter of discussion under the Fiscal system.<br>
      <br>
      Now, I would mention here that I would discuss about the taxation regime 
      in the modern time in an Islamic system. Now, it is true that in early 
      Islam the tax regime was not very big. Initially there was only land tax 
      or what we call ‘Kharaj’ and there was later, at the time of Omar-Al-Faruque, 
      custom duty was introduced on imports and exports. So this was a very 
      simple tax system. There was also revenue from state properly like the 
      state owned mines or forests. Then there was ‘Zakat’ and ‘Ushr’. But this 
      was not the part of the general taxation. This was a part of we can say 
      welfare taxation. The purpose of zakat and ushr is not to meet the general 
      expenditure of administration or for construction of the roads and 
      highways. The purpose of zakat and ushr is for poverty alleviation or 
      eradication and not general purpose. So these were the heads in the 
      beginning and may be the government was also not very complex at that 
      time. The administration was small and money realised from these heads was 
      enough to meet the expenditure of that time. <br>
      <br>
      However, I must mention here that the administration is now very complex 
      and we require much more revenue. So this came up in the Fiqh literature 
      or in the juristic literature, wheather the government can tax other then 
      those which were imposed in the early days of Islam and the consensus is 
      now that the government can impose any tax that is necessary for the 
      country for its development. Any body can look into the book of Dr. 
      Yusuf-al-Qardawi “Fiqhluz Zakat” in Arabic (in Bangali Islamer Zakater 
      Bidhan) where he has dealt the question at length over a hundred page and 
      he has concluded that the general consensus is that the state is empowered 
      to impose whatever taxes are needed. However they have emphasised that 
      there should not be unjust taxes. The govt. should remember, while taxing, 
      that there should not be any unjust taxation or such heavy taxation which 
      people cannot bear. But this is a relative issue, subjective issue. What 
      is heavy and what is necessary is a mater of judgement for the Govt. and 
      the Parliament who pass the budget. For this it is my submission that 
      taxes in Islamic state now will be more or less same. Like any other state 
      we shall have the custom duties, income taxes, value added taxes (VAT) or 
      sales tax. <br>
      <br>
      It is not necessary to levy special tax on the non-Muslims. As long as the 
      non-Muslims pay taxes like Income tax, Customs duties, Value Added Tax,etc. 
      as token of their obligation and obedience to the state, there is no need 
      for a special tax only on Non-Muslims. Islamic states of Iran, Pakistan, 
      Saudi Arabia,do not think it necessary to impose a special tax on 
      Non-Muslims in particular name.<br>
      <br>
      This is also the view of the great jurist of the current age Dr. Yousuf 
      Al-Qaradwabi. He mentions that Umar bin Al-Khattab, the 2nd Khalifa of 
      Islam on the request of the Christians of Banu Taglib dropped 'zizia' and 
      imposed another tax (as at that time there was no modern tax payable by 
      all). Dr. Qaradawi wrote, &quot; Real situation of present time is that the 
      non-Muslims do not want to pay Zizia. No Muslim state is realising this 
      also. They can pay another tax equal to Zakat. It is not necessary to name 
      it as Zizia........................ &quot; (Dr. Yousuf Al-Qaradawi, Fiqhuzzakat, 
      Vol. I, “Zizia” Section.<br>
      <br>
      Hazrat Umar (RA) wanted to realise 'Zizia' from Banu Taglib. Hazrat Numan 
      Ibn Zuraa (RA) said “Banu Taglib is an Arab tribe, they did not like to 
      pay Zizia..........”, then Umar imposed another tax ........... Imam Abu 
      Obaid had written that he (Umar) took from Banu Taglib tax but did not 
      keep the name of 'Zizia', but kept the name 'Sistanit Sadaqah’...... It 
      has been mentioned in the tradition that &quot;Allah has planted truth in the 
      tongue and heart of Umar ........ Imam Abu Ubaid says, it is one of the 
      most beautiful acts of Umar (Kitabul Amwal). (Dr Monzer Kahf during 
      discussion on the paper mentioned that Zizia is not revelent in the modern 
      states as these are not conquered territories rather these states mostly 
      have been established by the joint struggle of the Muslims and 
      non-Muslims. Syed Abul-Ala Maududi has also stated in his book &quot;Rasail Wa 
      Masail&quot; (Vol. IV, page 158, Bangladesh Edition published by Syyed Abul Ala 
      Maududi, Maududi Research Academy, Moghbazar, Dhaka) in response to a 
      question on rights of Non-Muslims that Zizia is applicable only in case of 
      citizens of conquered territories and not applicable to the non-Muslim 
      citizens of country like Pakistan and Bangladesh). <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      So the tax regime in an Islamic state will not be very different except 
      that the Islamic govt. is likely be of honest and public minded people. As 
      for the expenditure policy which is the other part of the fiscal system, 
      Islamic state will be more prudent and careful of the rights of the 
      people. It is an obligation under Islam that the need of all people should 
      be fulfilled. The state is under an obligation to fulfill the needs of all 
      people and poverty must be eliminated. So, there will be more emphasis on 
      elimination of poverty than the current time or there will be more 
      emphasis in reduction of poverty and also need fulfillment of the needs of 
      people. The demand of justice is that before you meet the luxuries of the 
      rich people, you meet the need of all people.<br>
      <br>
      I understand that in a private sector driven economy the production will 
      be free and the market will be free. But even than the govt. policies like 
      monetary policies and the fiscal policies and the banking policies will be 
      full geared to fulfillment of the needs of the people before the luxuries 
      of the rich are fulfilled. These are the initial comment about the fiscal 
      system of Islam.<br>
      <br>
      Now coming to the topic, public sector financing under Islamic framework I 
      would first submit that it will depend on what we mean by public sector 
      and what will be the size of public sector. If we take the case of 
      Bangladesh, now i.e. the end of the 2002 and the beginning of 2003, then I 
      will say that public sector is gradually going to be a small sector. Most 
      of the industries are in private sector and govt. is gradually withdrawing 
      from the industry and commercial activity. Recently Adamjee Jute Mill has 
      been closed and now another dockyard has been closed. I believe that the 
      public sector enterprises will be gradually sold out or closed down. So 
      the public sector size will be small in so far as industries and 
      commercial activities are concerned. But I think public sector size will 
      be considerable in communication (ports, highways). I believe in the long 
      run public sector role in education will be less though it is very big 
      now. But I think education will go to private sector in the long run like 
      other countries. May be, that govt. scholarship program will increase. But 
      owning of all schools, colleges and universities is not the appropriate 
      policy for the government as far as I understand from the scenario of the 
      last thirty-forty years. In this connection, I would mention that whereas 
      there are only 15 or 20 govt. sector universities, there are already 40 
      private universities.<br>
      <br>
      Now, how to finance? Whatever the size of the public sector, how to 
      finance the expenditure of the public sector? I believe that like any 
      other country the financing has to be made essentially from the revenues 
      of the govt., by raising taxes and expanding it wisely. It would not have 
      any top heavy administration or big administration. It should have a small 
      size administration so that the revenues are not spent mostly on paying 
      salaries and the allowances or the facilities of officers and staff. In 
      any event we have to have, finance from the revenues. Second I believe 
      that a part of the expenditure has to be met from foreign loan. I am not 
      for taking too much loan. I believe that the foreign aid is a trap to make 
      the countries slave. A new imperialism is emerging, new political and 
      economical imperialism is emerging. One or two countries are trying to 
      dictate the whole world, because most of the countries are in debt. This 
      is a new kind of slavery- debt slavery, you can call it. The only way to 
      get out of it is not to depend on foreign aid or foreign assistance or 
      loan May be for countries like us it would be difficult in one day but we 
      should make a policy. Let us eliminate the need for foreign assistance 
      over ten years. If we reduce every year our foreign aid need by ten 
      percent, then dependence on foreign aid we can eliminate within ten years. 
      So this is what is important to achieve, this will require serious 
      political commitment of the govt. to do it. <br>
      <br>
      So I would say that for the public sector financing, I don’t suggest to 
      get foreign aid or foreign assistance. We have to depend on revenue. May 
      be, part of the finance can be done by the high powered money created. We 
      know every year Central Bank creates new money or what we call high 
      powered money which is approximately ten percent of the current money. The 
      Central Bank can give this money free in stead of giving on interest to 
      the govt. They can take only a service charge from the government. This 
      money can be used by the govt. in financing the public sector project and 
      particularly the poverty alleviation program. This can be helped very 
      seriously if the govt. with the consent of the top ulama of the country 
      launches a program for zakat collection on a obligatory basis. That is of 
      course, difficult. But it is possible. At least effort should be made. So 
      that those who are hard core poor like the widows and disabled without any 
      financial support or the orphans can be taken care of by the zakat money. 
      I would like to suggest that govt. can raise Islamic bonds also in Islamic 
      framework and the money can be used only in partly helping the Islamic 
      Banks to tide over monitory problem, partly in financing those projects of 
      the government where it is possible under profit sharing arrangement.<br>
      I feel that if the govt. follows prudent policy of avoiding wastes and mis-expenditure, 
      I don’t find any difficulty in public sector financing under Islamic 
      framework.</td>
