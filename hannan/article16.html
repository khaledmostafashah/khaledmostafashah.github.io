      <p align="justify">I became acquainted with the writings of Mahammad Asad, 
      who wrote the Message of the Quran, in 1963 when I was under training in 
      the Finance Services Academy in Lahore, Pakistan. The library of the 
      Academy had the books of Mohammad Asad. I first read his “The Principles 
      of the State and Government in Islam&quot;. It is one of the very first books 
      written in the current time on the Political System of Islam. Then I read 
      his Islam in the Cross Roads where he has discussed the modern and current 
      important problems facing Islam and the Muslims. At this time I read his 
      autobiographical book Road to Mecca. In this book he has discussed his 
      life and experience and also expounded some of his views on Islam. When 
      the First Volume of his The Message of the Quran was published (probably 
      in 1964, translation was not completed then), I read it 1966 or ‘67. I was 
      greatly impressed by the translation and the commentary. I remember that 
      Professor Khurshid Ahmad once told me that this was the best translation 
      of the Quran in English language. <br>
      <br>
      In this translation of the Quran, Asad has not made literal translation, 
      rather the spirit has been presented, same thing has been done by Maulana 
      Maududi in his Urdu translation of the Quran Tafhimul Quran. But in the 
      note of the translation, Asad has given the literal translation of the 
      verses as well where needed. So those who want literal translation, they 
      would also get it. <br>
      <br>
      Asad was such a genius that he knew Arabic and English better than their 
      native speakers, though these were not his mother tongues. This is 
      reflected best in his Tafsir of the Quran. <br>
      <br>
      Asad has added very significant notes in his Tafsir (commentary). He not 
      only presented his understanding of the Verses of the Quran, but also 
      presented the views of the earlier scholars, particularly when he dealt 
      with controversial issues. His tafsir shows his command of earlier Tafsir 
      Literature. He was representative of Islam’s humanistic and rationalist 
      trend. But according to my understanding, he never forsook the spirit of 
      Islam or did not surrender to the other civilizations, though some people 
      say so. One of the characteristics of his Tafsir is that it is free from 
      gender bias. It is his great success. We don’t see it in many Tafsirs. <br>
      <br>
      For example, he has translated the first verse of Sura Nisa as below: <br>
      O mankind! Be conscious of your Sustainer Who has created you out of one 
      living entity and out of it created its mate, and out of the two spread 
      abroad a multitude of men and women. <br>
      <br>
      His note No.1 of Sura Nisa is as follows: <br>
      <br>
      Out of the many meanings attributable to the term nafs- soul, sprit, mind, 
      animate being, living entity, human being, person, self (in the sense of a 
      personal identity), human kind, life essence, vital principle and so 
      forth- most of the classical commentators choose ‘human being’ and assume 
      that it refers here to Adam. Muhammad Abduh, however, rejects this 
      interpretations (Manar-IV) and gives instead preference to humankind 
      inasmuch as this term stresses the common origin and brotherhood of the 
      human race (which undoubtedly, is the purport of the above verse) without, 
      at the same time, unwarrantably tying it to the Biblical account of the 
      creation of Adam and Eve. My rendering of nafs, in this context, as 
      ‘living entity’ follows the same reasoning. As regards the expression 
      Zawjaha (its mate), it is to be noted that with reference to animate 
      beings the Zawj, (‘a pair’, ‘one of a pair’ or ‘a mate’) applies to the 
      male as well as to the female component of a pair or couple; hence, with 
      reference to human beings, it signifies a woman’s mate (husband) as well 
      as man’s mate wife). Abu Muslim as quoted by Razi interprets the phrase “ 
      he created its mate (i.e. its sexual counterpart) out of its own kind (min 
      jinsiha)” thus supporting the view of Muhammad Abduh referred to above. 
      The literal translation of minha as ‘out of it’ clearly alludes, in 
      conformity with the text to biological fact that both sexes have 
      originated from the ‘one living entity’. <br>
      <br>
      Asad in his commentary has accepted, subject to possible meanings of the 
      Quranic verse, very rational explanations. In this connection we can 
      mention the issue of marriage of ‘slave girl’ and ‘hur’. He has translated 
      Ayat 24 of Sura Nisa as follows (part): <br>
      <br>
      And (forbidden to you are) all married women other than those whom you 
      rightfully possess [through wedlock] <br>
      <br>
      On this he has given note no.26 of Sura Nisa as follows: <br>
      <br>
      “According to almost all the authorities, almuhsanat denotes in the above 
      context” ‘married women’. As for the expression ‘ma malakat aymanukum’ 
      (“those whom your right hands possess”, i.e. “those whom you rightfully 
      possess”), it is often taken to mean female slaves captured in a war in 
      God’s cause (see in this connection 8:67 and corresponding note). The 
      commentators who choose this meaning hold that such slave girls can be 
      taken in marriage irrespective of whether they have husbands in the 
      country of origin or not. However, quite apart from the fundamental 
      differences of opinion, even among the companion of the Prophet, regarding 
      the legality of such a marriage, some of the outstanding commentators hold 
      the view that ‘ma malakat aimanukum’ denotes here “women whom you 
      rightfully possess through wedlock”; thus Razi in his commentary on the 
      verse and Tabari in one of the alternative explanations (going back to 
      Abdullah Ibn Abbas, Mujahid and others). Razi, in particular, points out 
      that the reference to ‘all’ married women (al-muhsanat min an-nisa) coming 
      as it does after enumeration of prohibited degrees of relationship, is 
      meant to stress the prohibition of sexual relations with any woman other 
      than one’s lawful wife. <br>
      <br>
      In this connection note No.3 of Sura Al-Muminun is the Message of the 
      Quran is also very significant which is given below: <br>
      <br>
      “or those whom their right hands possess” ( aw ma malakat aymanuhum ). 
      Most of the commentators assume unquestioningly that this relates to 
      female slaves, and that the particle aw (“or”) denotes a permissible 
      alternative. This conventional interpretation is, in my opinion, 
      inadmissible inasmuch as it is based on the assumption that sexual 
      intercourse with one’s female slave is permitted without marriage: an 
      assumption which is contradicted by the Quran itself (see 4:3, 24, 25 and 
      24:32, with the corresponding notes). Nor is this the only objection to 
      the above-mentioned interpretation. Since the Quran applies the term 
      “believers” to men and women alike, and since the term ‘azwaj’ 
      (“spouses”), too, denotes both the male and the female partners in 
      marriage, there is no reason for attributing to the phrase ‘ma malakat 
      aymanuhum’ the meaning of “their female slave”; and since, on the other 
      hand, it is out of the question that female and male slaves could have 
      been referred to here, it is obvious that this phrase does not relate to 
      slaves at all, but has the same meaning as in 4:24 - namely, “those whom 
      they rightfully possess through wedlock” (see note 26 on 4:24) - with the 
      significant difference that in the present context this expression relates 
      to both husbands and wives, who “rightfully possess” one another by virtue 
      of marriage. On the basis of this interpretation, the particle aw which 
      precedes this clause does not denote an alternative (“or”) but is, rather, 
      in the nature of an explanatory amplification, more or less analogous to 
      the phrase “in other words” or “that is” thus giving to the whole sentence 
      the meaning, “…save with their spouses - that is, those whom they 
      rightfully possess [through wedlock] …” etc. (Cf. a similar construction 
      25:62- “for him who has the will to take thought- that is [lit., “or”] has 
      the will to be grateful”) <br>
      Similarly he has given very rational explanation of hur. He writes in note 
      no.8 of Sura Waqia as follows: <br>
      <br>
      The noun ‘hur’ rendered by me as ‘companions pure’- is plural of both 
      ahwar (masculene) and hawra (female), either of which describes “ a person 
      distinguished by hawar” which latter term primarily denotes ‘in dense 
      whiteness of the eyeball and lustrous black of the iris’ (Qamus). In a 
      more general sense, hawar signifies simply ‘whiteness’ (Asas) or, as a 
      moral qualification ‘purity’ (cf. Tabari, Razi and Ibn Kathir in their 
      explanations of the term hawariyyun in 3:52). Hence the compound 
      expression ‘hur’ in signifies, approximately, “pure beings [or, more 
      specially ‘companions’ pure], most beautiful of eye” (which latter is the 
      meaning of ‘in’, the plural of Ayan). <br>
      <br>
      As regards the term ‘hur’ in its more current feminine connotation, quite 
      a number of earliest Quran commentators, among them Al-Hasan al Basri- 
      understood it signifying no more or no less than “the righteous among the 
      women of the human kind “(Tabari),-” [even] those toothless women of yours 
      whom God will resurrect as new beings” (Al-Hasan as quoted by Razi in his 
      comments on 44:54) <br>
      <br>
      The whole of the commentary of Asad is an extraordinary work. There was 
      always some difference of attitude in the Quranic commentary. This is very 
      natural and it always happens among the scholars. <br>
      <br>
      In the end, Asad has added 4 appendixes on symbolism and allegories in the 
      Quran, Al-Muqatta'at (independent letters), Jinn and Night Journey. These 
      are extremely useful appendixes. <br>
      <br>
      Those who want to enter deeply into Tafsir literature must read Asad’s 
      commentary, as they should read other important tafsirs of the past and 
      present.</td>
