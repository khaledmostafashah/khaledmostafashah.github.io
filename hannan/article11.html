      <p align="justify">Khilafat is a very important concept in Islam. It has 
      important implications in the political system of Islam. Many important 
      groups have made it a part of their programme to establish Khilafat.<br>
      It is therefore necessary to be clear about the concept of Khilafat has 
      three important dimensions. In the moral and spiritual sense, Khilafat 
      means that all human beings are 'Khalifa of Allah' or representatives of 
      Allah on earth. This is the purport of the verse &quot;Surely, we are going to 
      place our representatives (Khalifa) on earth&quot; [verse 30 : Sura Baqara]. 
      All human beings are khalifa of Allah though many of them commit sins and 
      do not act like khalifa. (Ref. : Quran - 6:165; 27:62 and 35:39). This is 
      the spiritual khilafat in Islam. <br>
      Khilafat also means the political system of Islam. This is the most 
      mentioned dimension of Khilafat. Khilafat, as a system of politics and 
      management of state was established by the companions of Prophet (SM). The 
      main points of khilafat or political system of Islam are as follows : <br>
      a. Sovereignty of Allah which means supremacy of Shariah (Quran and Sunnah). 
      The basic law of the state shall be based on the Quran and the Sunnah. The 
      detailed subsidiary law is obtained by Ijtihad carried out by individual 
      or groups of scholars or made by the Parliament in the present day world 
      with the aid of the Ulama or scholars of Islam. <br>
      b. Government established by the free choice of the people. This is the 
      majority view. In the present world, this means government elected by the 
      people. There is agreement on this among the Ulama of Islam. There is 
      hardly any major difference. This is the system accepted in the Islamic 
      constitutions in force in the Muslim world. <br>
      c. Fundamental rights : All citizens should have human rights irrespective 
      of gender or creed. The Islamic Constitutions of the world have a chapter 
      on the Fundamental rights or Rights of the people which are available to 
      all the citizens in the state. These rights have been agreed to or 
      confirmed by Ulama after long debates in the light of the Quran and Sunnah.
      <br>
      d. Rule of Law and Independence of Judiciary are important points of 
      Islamic political system. <br>
      e. Shura or consultation with the people and among the persons in the 
      Government through various forum including Parliament is an important 
      element in Islamic political theory. This is the basis of democracy in 
      Islam.Large number of scholars feel that the term democracy can be used in 
      Islamic framework. (Ref. : Preamble of Islamic constitution of Pakistan 
      which says that the state shall strive to observe &quot;democracy as enunciated 
      by Islam&quot;. Ulama accepted this phrase. ) <br>
      These are the various elements of Islamic political system which go to 
      make Khilafat (Ref. : Khilafat and Mulukiat by Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi, 
      other books on Islamic Political thought and Islamic Constitutions of Iran 
      and Pakistan). <br>
      The third dimension of Khilafat is that it means the form of Government in 
      Islam. The Ulama have now agreed by and large that in the framework of 
      overall Islamic political theory, both Presidential and Parliamentary 
      Governments of to-day are consistent with Islam (Ref. : Islamic 
      Constitution of Iran and Pakistan, Islamic Law and Constitution by Sayyid 
      Abul Ala Maududi,). <br>
      In the present circumstances, it is our duty to try to run our respective 
      states on the basis of Islamic principles or the principles of Khilafat as 
      outlined above. In fact almost all major Islamic parties are working in 
      this direction which is the right political course in the present 
      circumstances.<br>
      In conclusion, we can say that Khilafat does not only mean that the 
      President should be called Khalifa, it is much more than that. It is in 
      essence the political system of Islam. </td>
