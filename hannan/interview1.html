      <p align="justify">Mr Shah Abdul Hannan was interviewed by the Prothom Alo, 
      a premier Bengali daily of Bangladesh, on 13 April 2003. This interview is 
      significant for a number reasons, one of them being the aspects of his 
      moderation and optimism. In the interview he appears to be one of the few 
      thinkers who believe that, in the wake of the Iraq War, rather than 
      terrorism and extremist, persuasive rediscovery of our own selves and 
      intellectual regeneration would follow within the Muslim Ummah. Here is a 
      summary of the interview.<br>
      <br>
      Mr Hannan in his interview touches mainly upon four broad issues: question 
      of legality of US action in Iraq; state of the UN in the context of the 
      War; impact of the War on the economy of the vulnerable countries like 
      Bangladesh and predicaments and prospect for the Ummah as a whole.<br>
      <br>
      On the question of legality, Mr Hannan observes that the US, drawing from 
      the grave consequences of resolution no.1441 of the UN, claimed that it 
      possessed the right to attack Iraq. But he notes that legal experts of the 
      world, global popular opinion and 99 per cent of the journalists do not 
      think that there was any logic or legal coverage behind the attack. In 
      this connection he points out that the US did take the same illegal course 
      of action in Afghanistan where for the first time in modern history a de 
      facto government was dethroned and replaced by another one. He remarks 
      that people don’t know whether the Taliban government was bad or good, nor 
      do they know whether Osama bin Laden was bad or good; at least no criminal 
      charge against him was proved and there was no warrant issued against him. 
      But the US muscled in on Afghanistan to topple the Taliban government. The 
      same thing happened with Iraq when the US attacked the country ignoring 
      the central message of the UN resolution no. 1441.<br>
      <br>
      On the question of the governance of post-war Iraq, Mr Hannan says that he 
      does not think that the American Generals have any right to govern Iraq. 
      If there should be any interim government, it is the Arab League which 
      should get the first priority. The Secretary General of the Arab League 
      should be the right person to lead the interim government. If that does 
      not come through, the Secretary General of the OIC should take the lead. 
      Even if that is not possible, the UN Secretary General with his 
      representatives should run the country for three, six or twelve months. 
      During this time, he would consult all political groups and take 
      initiative to create environment for an election. At any rate, the 
      Anglo-American army should be withdrawn immediately and various Arab 
      forces, including Egyptian, Sudanese, Algerian and even Saudi Arabian, 
      should be deployed.<br>
      <br>
      In the context of the War, the death-blow, according to Mr Hannan, was 
      meted out not only to Iraq but also to the UN. He observes that the UN is 
      no more there as a viable institution. He points out that the UN is good 
      only when it approves the wishes and whims of America. Whether by 
      pressure, or by law or by any other influences, the US gets the UN 
      resolutions passed in its favour. Where it fails, it uses veto or dubious 
      words in order to exploit the vagueness. For instance, in the Resolution 
      which was passed after the Arab-Israel war of 1967 by the pressure of the 
      US, it was stated that Israel needed to be within a ‘safe and secured 
      border’. Since it cannot be said definitely what does this ‘safe and 
      secured border’ means, no political solution to the Israel-Palestine 
      problem could follow. Mr Hannan therefore suggests that a new alternative 
      UN should be established. This can be done by the members of the NAM. The 
      new UN should be free from veto power and there should be votes from 
      four-fifth of the members in order to reach an important decision.<br>
      <br>
      On the prospects of political and economic vulnerability of the poorer and 
      weaker countries, for instance Bangladesh, in an age when US spectre looms 
      large, Mr Shah Abdul Hannan categorically notes that the small states have 
      to be self-dependent and self-sufficient by coming out of the trap of 
      foreign aid. According to him, the shackles of foreign aid denote shackles 
      of slavery which has been in place through the Britton Woods institutions 
      for the last fifty years. Replying to the observation that such process of 
      reorganization of the economy of the weaker states was not easy, Mr Hannan 
      says that Bangladesh’s dependence on foreign aid is only ten per cent. If 
      we want we can come out of the net of foreign aid in next ten years time. 
      It’s a matter of decision on our part. For that, our civil servants, 
      political leadership and military personnel have to be sacrificing-minded. 
      We have to forget about the chances of our getting foreign consultancy, 
      foreign training and foreign currency and foreign scholarship for our 
      children. Referring to question whether weaker countries even after being 
      economically self-sufficient could thwart the military and political 
      threat from the powerful states, Mr Hannan says that along with attempt at 
      economic well being, a nation has to go through scientific and 
      technological development. Military development should also be encouraged 
      since the UN can no more extend shelter against aggression of the mighty. 
      On the question of development aid, Mr Hannan points out that of 8-billion 
      dollar budget of Bangladesh, 1 billion or 15 per cent comes from outside. 
      We could get at least 10 per cent of the amount from Japan, Saudi Arabia, 
      Germany, France and Korea. <br>
      <br>
      Mr Shah Abdul Hannan concludes his interview by expressing enormous 
      optimism about political and intellectual development within the Ummah. He 
      thinks that whether they say openly or not, the statesmen of the Muslim 
      world have realized by heart and soul that they can no longer depend on 
      the US. An atmosphere for the unity of the Muslim world has been created 
      within our deeper conscience. This unity in mind would reflect in the 
      material world, Mr Hannan believes. He doubts the soundness of the popular 
      prediction that hundreds of Osama Bin Laden would emerge in the wake of 
      the War in Iraq. He instead hopes that the people of the Muslim world are 
      becoming more and more realistic. They want Islam, not extremism, which 
      has proved harmful to Islam. What follows therefore is that there will be 
      a rise of Islamic consciousness which will lead them to try to come out of 
      the influence of the US. This consciousness would be reflected in the 
      field of politics, economy, and intellectual exercises. The tendency to 
      think that the US is our friend and it will take care of us would fade 
      away. Mr Shah Abdul Hannan thinks that this realization is a positive turn 
      and this could be the biggest achievement in the context of the 
      contemporary situation.</td>
