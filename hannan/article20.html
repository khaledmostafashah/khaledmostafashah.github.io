    <td width="100%"> <p align="justify">The characteristics of Islamic economy 
        can be explained in various ways. I find the following as representative 
        characteristics of a truly functioning Islamic economy or what ought to 
        be in such an economy.<br>
        <strong>Basic Characteristics of Islamic Economy</strong><br>
        1. Freedom of work and enterprise: Islam has allowed freedom of work and 
        enterprise. This is evident from the Madinitc model of Islamic economy. 
        A reading of the chapter of any Hadith collection in respect of agriculture, 
        gardening, business etc. will establish this. The Quran also clearly states 
        that &quot;Allah has made business lawful for you (Sura Baqara, Ayat - 
        275)&quot; <br>
        Islam essentially allows economy to operate freely according to the market 
        forces subject to Islamic restrictions and guidelines on production. distribution, 
        marketing, investment trade, exchange, wages etc. The state can also further 
        interfere in this free economy to restore equilibrium and establish justice 
        and other Islamic objectives . In an Islamic economy, there is an &quot;allowability 
        constraint&quot; (a term introduced by Dr. S.N.H Naqvi in his book. (S.N.H. 
        Naqvi: Ethics and Economics. An Islamic Synthesis, First edition, Chapter-5, 
        published by Islamic Foundation, U.K).<br>
        An entrepreneur can produce only permitted things. Profit should be normal 
        in such an economy after giving proper wages to the labourers in accordance 
        with Islamic principles. Some forms of trade practices, exchange, investment, 
        and land tenancy in agriculture are prohibited in Islam. It also disallows 
        monopoly and hoarding as social evils. The aforesaid restrictions make 
        &#8220;free economy &#8220;in Islam qualitatively different from capitalism. 
        Islam con not be said to be capitalistic only because it allows forces 
        of demand and supply to operate in the economy. Forces of demand and supply 
        are fundamental economic forces, which were operational even before capitalism.<br>
        2. A special concept of ownership: In Islam God is the true owner of all 
        things. The Quran says: &quot;To Allah belongs whatever is in the earth&quot;. 
        (Al- Imran). However, Allah in His mercy allows human beings to inherit 
        wealth, own it and use it subject to His laws as evident from the following 
        verses:<br>
        i) The land belongs to Allah. He allows it, to be inherited by whomso 
        ever he pleases. (Sura Araf, Ayat: 128).<br>
        ii) Do they not see that we have created for them ----- among the things 
        fashioned by us----- cattle of which they become owners? (Sura Yasin, 
        Ayat: 29). Islam, therefore, allows man as Vice-gerant, to inherit from 
        Allah (that is to own) wealth. This is indeed a trust for proper use. 
        We may call it Trust ownership.<br>
        3. Kinds of Ownership: In early Islam there were three kinds of ownership: 
        private, communal and state ownership. The books' of Hadith are full of 
        accounts of individual ownership. This was the standard ownership. Some 
        important things like water, canals pastures and graveyards were communal 
        properties. The state owned the mines, rivers and large tracts of land. 
        After the conquest of Syria and Iraq, these lands were made state lands 
        and were not allowed to go into private ownership.<br>
        (Tafhimul Quran, Sura Hashr, Syed Abul Ala Maududi) <br>
        4. State Ownership: There is no bar on state ownership of enterprise in 
        Islam. The basic economic institutions may be brought under state control, 
        if this is required to establish social justice or protect the interests 
        of the community. <br>
        Islam protects lawful property and is in favour of confiscation of unlawful 
        property. There are some instances of take over of unlawful property during 
        the period of Hazart Omar and Hazrat Omar bin-Abdul Aziz. Lawful property 
        can be taken over by the state only for valid social reasons after due 
        compensation. During the last Hajj the Prophet (SM) announced the principle 
        of protection of lawful property. The Quran says, &quot;don't eat each 
        other's property wrongfully &quot; (Sura Nisa,Ayat- 29).<br>
        5. Prohibition of Interest: Islam prohibits interest. This requires a 
        total reorganization of the economy, banking, investment, exchange, business 
        and international trade. Already in the last 30 years hundreds of Islamic 
        banks and financial institutions have been set up and this has become 
        an alternative mode in most Muslim countries and some non- Muslim countries. 
        Its viability and practicability has been accepted by economists and bankers 
        and many consider this system superior in some respects. A body of literature 
        has already come up on this subject. <br>
        6. Zakat: Islam has made Zakat compulsory on the wealth of rich Muslims. 
        This is spent for the weaker and distressed sections of the society. Zakat 
        not only distributes wealth between the rich and the poor of the society, 
        it also influences investment, savings and allocation of income and resources. 
        A detailed study has been made in this regard by Dr. Monzer Kahf in his 
        book &quot;Islamic Economy&quot; American Trust Publications, USA, A rich 
        body of literature has come up in recent times on Zakat. The Zakat and 
        Ushr ordinance of Pakistan can be particularly referred to in this connection.<br>
        7. Concern for Poor: This is a special feature of Islam. Zakat is one 
        institution which testifies to this. In this connection we may refer to 
        ayat 5-6 of Sura Qasas.<br>
        ) We desired to show favour into those who were depressed in the earth, 
        and to make them leaders and to make them inheritors and to establish 
        them on earth (Sura Qasas, Ayat: 5-6) <br>
        In these verses Allah, the Almighty has expressed His desire to show favour 
        on the depressed people. Islamic economy shall establish all possible 
        institutions to carry out this desire of the Almighty.<br>
        8. Distribution of inheritance: Islam has not left the distribution of 
        inheritance on the whims of a person, In Islam a person can not favour 
        one over the other of his relations for temporary or subjective reasons 
        as is the rule in the West. Islam distributes inheritable property among 
        several groups of people: <br>
        i) Children <br>
        ii) Husband/ Wife<br>
        iii) Parents <br>
        iv) Brothers and sisters in certain situations.<br>
        This distribution has taken care of different groups keeping in view their 
        social role, requirements and proximity of kinship relationships. For 
        those who remain outside the list of inheritors. Islam has provided for 
        wasiat (will) for all such relations if they are in a distressed condition. 
        A person can will upto one 3rd of his/her property for distressed relations 
        or others outside the inheritors.<br>
