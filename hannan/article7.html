      <p align="justify">An Interantional Hijab Day was observed in many places 
      of the world under Assembly for Protection of Hijab, which is an 
      organization set up in August 2004 within scholar in London. It was formed 
      in the beginning of August and they call for observance of International 
      Hijab Solidarity Day on 4th of September, 2004. With a group of scholar 
      and young activists in Bangladesh, the steering committee observing the 
      day including a seminar, a meeting in an open place and a press 
      conference. However the meeting in the open place could not be held the 
      then prevailing political situation. So the programme was limited to a 
      seminar on September 4 and a press conference on September 2. Press 
      conference was held in the VIP Lounge of National Press Club. The press 
      conference was address by Justice Abdur Rouf, former justice of appellate 
      division of Supreme Court, who was also the Election Commissioner of 
      Bangladesh, aided in the press conference by Shah Abdul Hannan, a former 
      secretary of the Gov. of Bangladesh, Dr. Razia Akter Banu, senior 
      professor department of Political Science, Dhaka University, Md. Abdul 
      Hannan, a senior cultural activists, Syeda Razia Sultana, an Assistant 
      Professor of Engineering University, a prestigious institution of Dhaka 
      and others.<br>
      <br>
      Below the summery of the statement of the press conference.<br>
      <br>
      In the beginning of the current year a law has been passed by the French 
      Parliament effectively banning, among others, wearing of headscarf ( Hijab) 
      First, The Prime Minister of France declared such an intent and Then 
      President Chirac called it an aggression on France. This law has become 
      effective from September 2, 2004 when the school year starts. The action 
      of the French Government and the Law has hurt the feelings of all Muslims 
      and religious people. France has said that this is against secularism. 
      This is a misinterpretation of secularism. Secularism is not opposed to 
      religious right.<br>
      <br>
      It is not also an aggression against France or its culture. This is also 
      not a religious symbol; This is an obligatory rule of Islamic Law, to deny 
      this right is denial of religious and human right. France has also said 
      that this is a way of political protest. This is a figment of their 
      imagination.<br>
      Hijab ( whatever be the form) is a part of Islamic dress code, it is no 
      part of political protest. In some states in Germany and political leaders 
      in some other European countries have called for ban of Hijab. So this is 
      a big issue which cannot be ignored. If it is allowed then interference 
      can<br>
      come in other religious rights of Muslims and even other religions. In 
      this context, Assembly for Protection of Hijab in London, an organisation 
      representing human right workers and religious leaders (including Ken 
      Livingstone, Yusuf Al Qaradari, Tariq Ramadan) have called for observance 
      of September 4, 2004 as International Hijab Solidarity Day. Rule of Hijab 
      is found in the Quran ( Verse 31 of Sura Nisa and verse 59 of Sura Ahzab). 
      Scholars are agreed that the body of Muslim Women except face, forehand 
      and feet have to be covered.<br>
      <br>
      In History, under the influence of Western civilization, King Amanullah of 
      Afghanistan, Shah of Iran tried to eradicate Hijab but they failed. Other 
      attempts in Iraq, Syria and Indonesia by some rulers failed. Turkish state 
      under Mustafa Kamal tried to abolish Hijab. Even now Turkish Women can not 
      wear Hijab in Govt. Schools and Offices &amp; Parliament. Marvan Kavakchi 
      could not take oath as parliament Member because of Hijab. The Wife of 
      Prime Minister Erdogan cannot go to official function wearing Hijab.This 
      rule can not be changed by the Present Islamic Government become of 
      pressure of Turkish Army bosses who worship secularism.<br>
      <br>
      This Hijab Solidarity day is very important. It cannot be ignored. It is a 
      religious issue. It is a human Right issue. It is recognized in U.N 
      Declaration of Human Rights. We are for human right of all people. We 
      request all people of all religions to stand up for this issue. Otherwise<br>
      religious right of all people will be affected in future. We request 
      France to revoke this law. <br>
      <br>
      The background of the Insternational Hijab Solidarity Day and also 
      protection of Hijab, I would now say the development since then. A full 
      pledged organization has been formed under the Assembly for Protection of 
      Hijab, Bangladesh under the leadership of Justice Abdur Rouf and Secretary 
      Md. Abdul Hannan. The organization includes many dignified intellectuals. 
      This organization will work as a watchdog on issues of Human Rights, 
      particularly issues regarding women and specifically on the issues of 
      Hijab. In Bangladesh any woman can wear Hijab without any restriction. 
      Hijab is increasing over the last ten to fifteen years. In rural areas 
      most of the women wear Hijab. In cities also now large number of women 
      wear Hijab. As per as there are unwritten rules, even in Bangladesh which 
      women who take up Hijab are not take on in the Television channel as a 
      newsreader. I remember, I wrote an article on the issue on a national 
      Daily called Daily Sangram, in the TV channel to allow the Muslim women 
      who want to put on Hijab, allow them to be a newsreader. I do not know 
      what will be the result. But I hope it may be possible. I also came to 
      know and this also mention in my article in the Daily Sangram that the 
      national flag carrier Biman does not allow women to wear Hijab which is 
      disgraceful. I gathered if from my own experience, because the last ten 
      years they allowed only two women to wear Hijab after their prayers. But 
      many prayers are still pending. This I came to know from a woman when I 
      was flying to Jeddah to attend an IDB meeting. I had discussion with 
      flight attended with Hijab and she explained to me that the unwritten role 
      is woman cannot become Air hostage with Hijab. But after their prayer two 
      have been allowed till that day and said twelve other applications have 
      been pending. I wrote in the article in the Daily Sangram that Biman 
      should allow it. I hope one day it would be done. When I look into 
      Bangladesh there are problem. There are many problems in many other 
      countries where Hijab is discouraged in many ways. At Human Rights and 
      Religious Rights of Muslim man and woman that the struggle must continue 
      and the organization of the Assembly for Protection of Hijab in necessary 
      not only international organization based in London but also national 
      organization to monitor the position.<br>
