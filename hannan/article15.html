      <p align="justify">Now I come to my topic. After these preliminary 
      observations coming to the topic, first of all, I submit that the state of 
      Ummah, the state of Muslim Ummah, the state of Islamic Ummah is not very 
      healthy. And I would not discuss a lot because you know very much in this 
      respect. But still I would say ideologically, there is much ignorance in 
      the Muslim community about Islam. Ideologically speaking, Islamically 
      speaking, from the Ummah stand point, there is much ignorance about Islam, 
      there is considerable Bida (innovation unacceptable in Shariah) in the 
      Muslim community, innovations which are not acceptable, which has been 
      judged innovations (in the technical terms of Fiqh) and also much Shirk in 
      the entire Muslim world or many parts of Muslim world. I cannot say what 
      is the real state in the UK, but I would say that the Muslim Ummah as a 
      whole is in much ignorance, much Bida and much Shirk. Materially speaking, 
      materially there is much illiteracy, much poverty, serious poverty and 
      backwardness in most of the places. Our economy is in bad shape by in 
      large except a few, we have bad defence. What should we do to build a 
      strong Ummah in such circumstances when our ideology is this and when our 
      material position is this, what should we do to build a strong Ummah? By 
      the way I would mention after the conclusion of my speech, I will be ready 
      to answer in all humility any question that you may give me. I do not say 
      I have all the answers but I will give whatever I know and the rest Allah 
      is our helper. So coming to the question what should we do to build a 
      strong Ummah. Again, I need not mention that, of course, we have to build 
      our education, we have to build our economy and we have to build our 
      defence. These are the priority areas before I look into the ideological 
      issues, I am mentioning the material aspect and I have to do this. Our 
      education, as you all know, in most of the countries, not in all 
      countries, are not fulfilling the needs of Islamic education. Let me say 
      my case, from my school to my university post-graduation in Dhaka 
      University, I was not taught 20 ayats of the Quran, In fact, I would say I 
      was not taught 10 ayats of the Qur’an. I was not taught the life of the 
      Prophet (sm) who is a model for us. So does this education system or 
      education fulfil our needs? It does not. The objective should be to build 
      ultimately in the independent Muslim countries strong Islamic education 
      system. I know it will take time and there is “ Sunnat Allah”- Allah’s 
      ways and many things are there where time is needed but the objective 
      should be clear that we have to achieve an education system which will 
      meet all our material needs, all our needs to live as good human being. At 
      the same time it must meet our Islamic needs, The education must meet, and 
      presently in most of the countries the education system is not patterned 
      in this line. But the objective should be clear to the Ummah that the 
      education is very important, most important for our material progress and 
      for our Dini (religious) progress, for our religious progress, for 
      ideological progress, the most important thing is education. And as long 
      as the education system is not fulfilling our needs, there is our duty to 
      privately study and know Islam thoroughly and fully, there is no other way 
      but private study. I would not take much time about economy. I mean, you 
      can realise you have to do a lot. I will not discuss today this issue only 
      indicating that all Muslim governments, all Muslim politicians, all Muslim 
      intellectuals must work. All Muslim economist must work for strong Muslim 
      economy. I will come back to this issue later. We have to build our 
      defence also. Allah has said to guard our borders. If you look into the 
      last ayats of Suratul Imran you will find Allah has asked us to guard our 
      borders and Allah has taught us to keep horses ready. By that Allah (SWT) 
      means we should keep our defence ready, we cannot be careless about the 
      defence of the Muslim Ummah, about the defence of the Muslim states and 
      defence of the Islamic states. De-nuclearisation, very good, but it must 
      be for all, not for only the Muslims. Disarmament of all. I mean we cannot 
      be asked to disarm ourselves, others keeping arms. It will not be fair, it 
      is not just. Now, I was talking about the building of Ummah and about the 
      material aspect I was indicating a little. But, today my thrust is not on 
      the material aspect, we must take into account the fact that the Ummah 
      itself is under attack, under threat. You know that there are major 
      scholars talking about the conflict of civilisation, An Amirican major 
      scholar Hungtington has spoken on the conflict of civilisation and it says 
      that Islam is the next threat to the western civilisation, as if the 
      western civilisation must be maintained, as if any threat against that 
      must be eliminited, as if it is the pinnacle of civilisation, as if it is 
      the last word. We do not accept western civilisation is the last word, I 
      will come back to that. Not only Hungtington, Fukuama in his book “The end 
      of history” says that history has reached its final stage, he means really 
      that secular democracy and capitalism are the two things which are the 
      final version of things that human being achieved, so nothing new will 
      come, nothing better will come. This is the end of history, but we cannot 
      accept that the secularism is the last word.<br>
      <br>
      The greatest problem of human civilisation is that they have forgotten the 
      guidance of Allah (SWT). And this is the reason of all the immoralities 
      you see in the world. And most of the fighting are on the basis of nation, 
      I agree there are fighting on the basis of religion also but a time has 
      come that we can contain that if we like. We cannot forsake morality and 
      surrender to immorality in the name of secularism that is forgetting the 
      guidance of Allah (SWT). Many of the evils of the world are due to really 
      the forgetting the guidance of Allah (SWT). I will come to that in course 
      of my lecture.<br>
      <br>
      The Challenge of the West<br>
      The challenge of the West to the Muslim Ummah is political, is cultural, 
      is economic and mostly, and most fundamentally intellectual. I need not to 
      discuss much about political challenge to the Ummah. What do the West 
      want? The West wants the Muslim countries should obey the dictates of the 
      West. It is not acceptable to us. When a Muslim country was about to blast 
      a bomb it gets a few telephone calls several times from the head of the 
      state of most important power of the world that “ You do not do that” So 
      much interference in the affairs of the Muslim states. They want us to 
      obey their dictates and if you obey their dictate they will never dictate 
      us for the good of the Muslims and for the good of the Islam. I do not say 
      that we will not listen to others on right matters, we should listen to on 
      right matters to others, but we cannot accept the political dictates of 
      the West. They want us to surrender to their culture which is mostly 
      indecent , lot of indecencies, lot of exposure of human body, exploiting 
      the women for money and lust of men. I do not know in Human history any 
      worse social system like this. Their marriage has been eliminated more or 
      less, their parents are neglected, their children are neglected. Neither 
      children have security, nor in the real sense, the parents have security. 
      In old days they have lots of problems. Their children are not getting 
      care of both father and mother, probably they are getting care of only one 
      in most cases but Allah has made it like that the children should get care 
      of both father and mother. Allah has not made it like this that the 
      children would get care of only the mother. They destroyed family for no 
      purpose at all, for worthless purpose. The marriage is a historically 
      sound institution. It has not harmed anybody, the family has not harmed 
      anybody. That, they have come to a situation where they, in fact, are 
      ruining their families. They are leading us to a chaos and condition. 
      Coming to economic aspect, the goal is really economic imperialism. They 
      want us to be second graders, 3rd graders, 4th graders. They want us to be 
      their market ultimately. Their institutions are all geared to the interest 
      of the major powers of the West. I know thoroughly, I have dealt with 
      them. They serve mostly the purpose of the West and not the purpose of the 
      humanity as a whole. But I must say, the basic challenge is really 
      intellectual. All the other challenge are there but the basic and most 
      fundamental challenge that is coming from the West is really intellectual. 
      They are charging, they are telling us that the concept of Islamic state 
      is not possible. It is not good to have Islamic states. They are telling 
      that Islam does not give human rights, they are telling that Islam does 
      not give women rights and I must say with great sorrow that some Muslims 
      act in a manner it appears that as if Islam does not give human rights or 
      women rights. There are some manifestations in some countries, some parts 
      which also give this impression. Unfortunately, we must not do that. We 
      must not give the backward, unnecessary backward image of Islam.<br>
      <br>
      Coming to the points of human rights and women rights, I would explain 
      that these are very much accepted in Islam. I will quote three basic 
      documents in support of human rights and women rights in Islam. The 
      constitution of Islamic Republic of Iran was drafted by Ulema, the 
      constitution of Islamic republic of Pakistan was, though not drafted but 
      accepted by Ulema of all groups. These two documents plus the writings of 
      the political scientists of the Islam. I would not name them all, I can 
      name only a few, like Muhammad Asad, like Abul ala Maududi, like Hasan 
      Turabi and so on, a political thinker in Bangladesh, late Moulana Abdur 
      Rahim in their writings. So I would say these documents which are drafted 
      by the Ulema or accepted by the Ulema indicated clearly that Islam has 
      given basic human rights. The Islamic constitution of Pakistan, has 
      chapter on Fundamental Rights. As I am a teacher in a University of 
      comparative political thought, I give my students Iranian constitution, I 
      give my students the Pakistan constitution. I give my students Bangladesh 
      constitution. I give my students American constitution. I explain them the 
      difference between the western democratic model and Islamic democratic 
      model. So I would say that the writings of political scientists, not 
      politicians, not ordinary Alims, but major Alims and major Islamic 
      politicians and political scholars and the other two basic documents, 
      which are drafted by Ulema or accepted by Ulema, clearly indicate that 
      Human rights are respected and women rights are guaranteed in Islam. So, 
      we should not hear some voices from here and there. We cannot lose the 
      consensus, We cannot ignore the consensus on the basis of some voices from 
      here and there. (You can also look into OIC declaration of Human Rights 
      which was approved by OIC Fiqh Academy).<br>
      <br>
      Let us look back at the causes of Muslim decline. As you all know we have 
      been at the fore-front of expansion of knowledge. It is the Muslims who 
      have been the principal actor in the field of knowledge in the 7th, 8th, 
      9th and 10th century. In the 11th, 12th, 13th century Muslim gave up the 
      pursuit of knowledge. What happened? Why?. I have not the full answer but 
      it appears to me that we neglected knowledge. It is clear from history 
      that we neglected knowledge which led to our decline and among other 
      things is Taqlid, the blind following. The Muslims started blindly 
      following the old scholars and forgot their duties of pursuit of knowledge 
      and Ijtihad by the senior scholars of Islam. If you want to know the level 
      of Taqlid, I can refer to a book which I went through, there is book 
      called Fatwah-e-Alamgiri which was prepared by 300 Alims at the time of 
      the Mughal Emperor, Aurangjeb. They have discussed about 5000 issues and 
      you will be surprised that after each issue nowhere they quoted any ayat 
      of the Quran, no where they quoted the Hadith of the Prophet (sm). They 
      quote some old books. They refer Tatarkhania, refer Shami, refer 
      Baharurraik and refer Muhit, never to the book of Allah and never to the 
      Hadith of Prophet (sm). After going through 12 volumes of Fatwai Alamgiri, 
      I was dismayed, I was surprised, I got a shock. I want to mention that 
      this taqlid was responsible for our decline. In such situation, the 
      challenge of the West, political, cultural, economic and intellectual, how 
      do we meet them, and also that we know the basic reasons of our decline, 
      what should we do? As I have said earlier we have to build economy and 
      education etc. no doubt but above all we have to face the intellectual 
      challenge of the West. If we want to build up an Islamic state, Islamic 
      Ummah, Islamic societies, if we want to build up Islam based economy and 
      economy based on Islamic values and politics based on Islamic values, 
      there is no other way but face the western challenge. Explain the reasons 
      behind Islamic injunction. As once upon a time Ilmul Kalam was developed 
      that explained the roots of our faith, our Akaid (beliefs). Similarly, we 
      have to build up new subjects, new responses to the challenge of the West, 
      the intellectual challenge of the West. I think the most important thing 
      is to build up individuals. If we have to build up strong Islamic Ummah we 
      have to build up individuals. Why I say so, ultimately who runs the state, 
      individuals, who runs the societies, individuals, who runs the economy, 
      individuals, who runs banks, individuals, who runs the government, 
      individuals. So my submission is that if we want to build strong Islamic 
      Ummah, and face the challenge of the West we must build Islamically 
      oriented individuals and great number of scholars and intellectuals in 
      each field. For this I would suggest, if I can say that the prescription 
      before us I would say is to build Islamic intellectuals. To build Islamic 
      individuals, apart from Iman, apart from Akhlak(character), apart from 
      practice, what is needed is I would say read, read, read. The prescription 
      is read, read, read. I would say read, read, read. Any person cannot be a 
      Islamic scholar unless he has read about 1000 Islamic books in addition to 
      another 500/600 books of general interest. A first class Islamic worker 
      cannot be prepared unless he has studied 500 Islamic books in addition to 
      another 200-300-400-500 books on general matters. I suggest that the 
      building up Ummah ultimately would depend on the one hand on to building 
      strong economy, strong defence, good education, good infrastructure and so 
      on for all of us. Facing the challenge of the West, threat of the West we 
      have to build individuals. Because, ultimately, the individuals run the 
      society.<br>
      <br>
      What should we read? I think we should read as many Tafsir of Quran as 
      possible, we should read as many commentry of Hadith as possible, we 
      should have a firm grounding on Usul al Fiqh. Who do not know Usul al Fiqh, 
      they do not understand how to classify Hadith. They do not know how to 
      infer, derive laws from the Quran and Sunnah. They have not heard about 
      Ibartunnas, they have not heard about Isaratunnas, they have not heard 
      about Dalatunnas. They have not heard about Iktedaannas. These are the 
      methods of derivation of the rules from the Qur’an and Sunnah. They have 
      not heard it. A firm foundation of Usul al Fiqh is needed for anybody who 
      wants to be a scholar of Islam and fight for Islam and work for Islam 
      seriously. If you want to be a general worker, no problem but if you want 
      to be serious worker. I can recommend a book to all of you in this regard 
      a good book which is basically based on Arabic work of Usul al Fiqh, is a 
      book by Dr Hashim Kamali, Islamic Jurisprudence published by Islamic Texts 
      Society, Cambrige. The book is based on all earlier works in Arabic by the 
      Ulema of Usul. I am coming to the close of my speech, so that you can ask 
      some questions. I will make two three points. One is, apart from studies, 
      we should take prophetic character, we should adopt the prophetic 
      character. People say it is not possible to follow the Prophet fully. I do 
      not agree. If it was not possible to follow the Prophet (sm), then Allah 
      would not have said the life of the Prophet is a model for you” or Prophet 
      (sm) would not have said his conduct is a Sunnah for all of us, he is a 
      model for all of us, is a guidance for all of us. I believe personally 
      that the need of the Muslim is to emulate Prophet (sm) fully. We should 
      behave with our wives as Prophet (sm) behaved with Ayesha (ra). It is 
      possible. It is possible to behave with our assistants as Prophet (sm) 
      behaved with Zaid(RA). It is not true that Prophet (sm) cannot be followed 
      fully. So, I mean this is not properly understood and lastly, I would 
      submit if we want to build strong Ummah, we must not ignore our women, we 
      must not forget our women. They have the same potential for Islam, they 
      have the same potential for Dawah, as man, because an ayat in the Qur’an 
      which was revealed in the 9th of Hijra in the last part of the Prophet’s 
      career says so. It is in Surattut Tawba. The Ayat is like this “ Wa al 
      muminuna………….” (9:71). This indicates that man and women are friend to 
      each other, protector to each other, helper to each other. What do they 
      do? The mumin man and women what do they do? The common duties are to 
      enjoin good and forbid evil, establish Salah, establish Zakat, follow 
      Allah and His Prophet. These six duties are the common duties of the 
      Muslim man and Muslim women. This ayat clearly proves that the potentials 
      of Muslim man and women are alike. We must not forget that the soul of 
      Muslim men and women are alike, same. I mean in the basic level man and 
      women are alike. There are differences of course. The structure of men and 
      women are not same. The responsibilities and duties sometimes are little 
      different. The basic levels are all the same, one. The souls are of same 
      type. Allah (SWT) has not said anywhere that the souls of man and women 
      are different. So, at the soul level, which is the most basic level, 
      ultimately what is a human being, nothing but the soul, and about it Allah 
      (SWT) says we are of the same type. Number two, despite all physical 
      differences, Allah says, the physical level of men and women are really 
      most excellent. Allah says in the Quran in Suratu Tin “Lakad Khalanal 
      Insana ...............&quot; that is, men women have the most excellent 
      structure. Any solitary Hadith cannot be quoted against this teaching of 
      the Qur’an. No majaji (allegorical) interpretation is possible here and 
      thirdly we belong to the same family-the family of Adam and Hawa as has 
      been stated in Sutatun Nisa. As we are all Muslims we must give the 
      opportunity to Muslim women to use and utilise their full potential. So in 
      conclusion I would say that we face major challenges in political field, 
      in economic field, in social field, in cultural field and mostly in 
      intellectual field. We have to prepare individuals, these individuals will 
      create Muslim society and Muslim state and Muslim economy and politics and 
      society and schools and education and Madrasha and Masjid. So I conclude 
      my speech here. Thank you. Assalmaualaikum.<p align="center">(Summary of a
