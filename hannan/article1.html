      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Actually, the paper of Prof Hans 
      Kippenberg is unfair to Islam. By any stretch of imagination; it cannot be 
      said to be an academic paper. He has directly blamed the violence of 9/11 
      in the United States on the conduct of the Prophet Hazrat Muhammad (SM) 
      and on the Quranic teachings. <br>
      <br>
      In the first para he said, “The document (claimed by the FBI to have been 
      found in three locations) shows that violence is justified by emulating 
      meticulously the moment in early Islamic history, when Mohammad cancelled 
      all contracts with non-Muslims in order to establish in Medina Islam as a 
      political order”.<br>
      <br>
      Prof Kippenberg, in fact, the FBI document (alleged to have been found 
      from the cells of the perpetrators of September 11) shows that those who 
      committed the violence emulated the Prophet, followed the Prophet who 
      cancelled all contracts with Non-Muslims in order to establish Islamic 
      state in Medina.<br>
      <br>
      In fact, the state of Medina was established by peaceful agreement with 
      the people of Medina, the Jews and the Muslims. It is about eight years or 
      nine years after the establishment of Medina that Prophet cancelled some 
      contracts (not all contracts) with the Beduin, Mushriks or idolaters 
      because they repeatedly were violating the contracts. So this is not true 
      that Prophet established the state of Medina after canceling all 
      contracts.<br>
      <br>
      He also said in his first paragraph that “The Manual explicity prescribes 
      recitations, prayers and rituals, by which member of the four cells 
      prepares of the ghazwa (war or battle), purifies his intention and 
      anticipates in his mind the stages of the struggle to come.” That means by 
      implication he had said in the whole paper that because they made 
      intention, they had mentioned about Quranic verses and because they spoke 
      about the sahadah or martyrdom, so this must be Islamic.<br>
      <br>
      Just by niya, zikr, prayer things do not become Islamic. He forgot the 
      phrase “devil quoting the scripture.” <br>
      <br>
      In this paper he accepts the truth of the FBI document. He clearly said, 
      “Only recently a scholarly edition, translation and analysis of the Arabic 
      text have been published in Germany. And the few serious studies of the 
      documents contradict the assumption of forgery.”<br>
      <br>
      Many people have said the document is a forgery. It cannot be the basis of 
      any study. But he strongly says that this is not forged. He has taken the 
      position of FBI and he has neglected the other views. <br>
      <br>
      He has quoted some verses from the Quran’s Sura Tauba. He mentions that 
      Prophet abrogated the agreement with the Musrikun and then said the 
      Prophet has asked to kill the Musrikun whenever you find them.<br>
      <br>
      He did not take into account the international policy of the Prophet, or 
      the policy towards the Murikun or the Maccan people or Jews, Persians, 
      Romans. All these depend on the context of the situation. Prophet’s policy 
      was not static, it was a dynamic policy. In the battle of Badr, he forgave 
      the persons and he released them. In Hudaybiah he entered into contract 
      with a very unjust opponent. After victory of Macca, he forgave all of 
      them. So, the policy of the Prophet was dynamic and contextual. <br>
      <br>
      If you read through Sura Tauba you will find that he did not cancel all 
      agreements. He only cancelled agreements with those Musrikun, who were 
      repeatedly violating the contract, who were treacherous, who were trying 
      to disturb the state.<br>
      <br>
      So Prophet cancelled their agreements. The Islamic Jurists agree that this 
      is only for Arab Musrikun of that time. The Quran did not say this is 
      applicable to Ahlal-Kitab, that is Christians and the Jews. It was not 
      applied on the Hindus or Buddhists by later jurists because they were 
      civilised and had religious books. But Prof Hans applied this against all. 
      He did not know that this is not applicable to Ahle Kitab. The Americans 
      are basically Ahle Kitab and it is not applicable to them. <br>
      <br>
      I am quoting the book, “Towards an Islamic Theory of Internaional 
      Relations” by Abdul Hamid A. Abu Sulaiman, (P-110) about this matter. He 
      said, “The issue of all-out war against the pagan Arab tribes unless they 
      turned to Islam cannot be understood as ideological oppression. This 
      decision came after the establishment of the Muslims state at Medina and 
      after the Muslim had undergone about twenty-two years of persecution and 
      war.” (IIIT Publication, Virginia, USA).<br>
      <br>
      So, Prof Hans Kippenberg was very unfair to Prophet (SM). He did not 
      understand the Islamic International Theory.<br>
      <br>
      In this seminar I was present. I explained there that the FBI document 
      cannot be basis of any academic studies. At the least it is doubtful, at 
      the worst it is to be rejected. Any doubtful material cannot be basis of 
      any investigation, research and any academic work. It shows the German 
      Professor willingly or unwillingly only served the interest of the enemy 
      of Islam. <br>
      <br>
      There, I also said he should not forget that all Islamic scholars are 
      agreed, and this is recorded in all books of Islamic law, that innocents, 
      civilians, women, children cannot be killed, temple cannot be destroyed in 
      war according to the Islamic law.<br>
      <br>
      That is the reason, all the Islamic scholars have said attack on Twin 
      Towers by whosoever (we do not know) is unlawful in the eye of Islam. 
      Islam is against the killing of civilian and women (there was 30% women 
      there).<br>
      <br>
      So, how can it be justified in the name of Islam? Islam also does not 
      allow any individual to declare war, only the state can do it. <br>
      <br>
      Now, I would conclude that I think whatever had happened only the paper 
      writer is responsible, nobody else BIISS. BIISS is not responsible in any 
      way. In fact, BIISS gave us an opportunity to explain the Islamic 
      position. I would also say that the seminar had good papers also.<br>
      <br>
      For example, the paper of Prof Dr Shamsher Ali. He clarified that religion 
      is for peace and the militancy is more political. Justice Mostafa Kamal 
      also explained that the West need not advise us. Their own record is very 
      bad in Palestine, Afghanistan, Iraq and many other places.<br>
      <br>
      However, such incidents are not uncommon in scholarly discourses. We 
      should take it in an academic spirit.</p>
