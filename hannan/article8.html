      <p align="justify">When this write-up will be published, we have already 
      observed the 50th UN Human Rights Day on December 10, 1998.<br>
      <br>
      Indeed the human rights document of the UN is a major one and by and large 
      world has agreed on basic aspects of human rights and the need for their 
      implementation in the various countries of the world. Those who worked for 
      the preparation of the documents on the basis of the experience of 
      humanity in history deserve our greatest admiration and thanks.<br>
      <br>
      Human rights are really fundamental to human existence and good life. 
      There may be some disagreement on the details of human rights, but there 
      is hardly any disagreement on basic aspects of human rights. Human rights 
      were always violated in the human history. The rulers, the local powerful 
      people mostly oppressed people and did not grant them full enjoyment of 
      human rights. Even the religious leadership in some cases was responsible 
      for violation of human rights, though this was not in the best spirit of 
      religious values.<br>
      <br>
      It was hoped that with the advent of modern times arrival of renaissance, 
      rise in education, the condition of human rights shall radically improve. 
      There has been of course improvement in some respects in some countries. 
      But life and liberty of people in most countries are still not safe. There 
      has been increase in terrorism by the state within and outside the 
      political borders of the state. We do not find any justification of 
      bombing in Sudan, Libya and Afganistan by one super power. The way one or 
      two powers threaten Iraq every now and then of military action shows that 
      some countries have given up even the mask of honorable behaviour. <br>
      <br>
      We have also seen recently the terrorism of Serbia in Bosnia and Kosovo. 
      State terrorism is also going unabated for long in Palestine and Kashmir. 
      Israel and India want to hold on to West Bank and Kashmir by force even 
      though the people of the area do not want them.<br>
      <br>
      State terrorism and violation of human rights has another dimension. It is 
      violation of human rights by the state security organs in their own 
      people. It is the most common type and prevalent in almost all countries. 
      In Bangladesh also several hundred people have died in police custody. 
      Torture in the hand of police and investigation agencies is a regular 
      feature. Though law does not permit it from my discussion with police 
      officials. I have found them mostly to justify it. Remand comes handy for 
      torture.<br>
      <br>
      After the death of Rubel , a young student, in the hands of police, most 
      people have demanded the abolition of remand system and Section 54 of Cr. 
      P.C. Justice Habibur Rahman Commission has given some suggestions. The 
      Govt. of Bangladesh should implement them without any delay.<br>
      <br>
      However, there should be no excess in the area of human rights. There are 
      people who have opposed action against blasphemy, pornography and &quot;living 
      together&quot;(without marriage) in the name of liberty, freedom and human 
      rights. These are perversions. We can not agree to such excessive freedom 
      as these are against our very good moral values. <br>
      <br>
      Human rights are far from being achieved. A great movement by moral 
      philosophers and activists will be needed to reach the goal and it will 
      probably take time.<p align="center">(Published in The Envoy, Dhaka, dated
