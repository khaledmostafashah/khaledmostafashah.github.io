      <font face="Times">Almighty Allah, the Creator of the universe, has His 
      own system to regulate and maintain all of His creations. We are the human 
      beings, the classic creation of Him. So, He is so much prompt for the 
      well-being of ours. In this regard, He always sends to us prophets with 
      the code of conduct that we should follow in our short stay of worldly 
      life satisfying Him and to pass into the life of eternity destined for us. 
      If we follow those codes of conducts accordingly, we could avail of the 
      peace in our earthly duration. Therefore, all the Muslim population should 
      try to lead life according to the code of conduct send by Allah through 
      the Quran and Sunnah.</font></p>

      <font face="Times">Economic approach and system, being the key factor 
      among all the worldly activities by human being, should also be 
      systematically regulated as per sanctions of the Quran and Sunnah. To the 
      believers of the Quran and Sunnah, financing must be interest free. 
      Keeping in mind this reminder, some national and international Islamic 
      organizations and Muslim business organizers ventured to establish the 
      Islami Financial System through Islami Shariah based bank. Islami Bank 
      Bangladesh Limited is the first of its kind in Bangladesh. At present, the 
      Board of Director is chaired by Mr. Shah Abdul Hannan, a former Secretary 
      to the Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh. </font></p>

      <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times">Mr. Shah Abdul Hannan: Islami Bank 
      Bangladesh Limited was incorporated on 13th March 1983 under the Company 
      Act, 1913. The bank started functioning with effect from 30th March 1983.

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 7.5pt 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
      <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times">Mr. Hannan: In August 1974, Bangladesh 
      signed the Charter of Islamic Development Bank. Bangladesh committed 
      itself to re-organize its economic and financial system as per Islamic 
      Shariah. In January 1981, at the 3rd Islamic Summit Conference, Late 
      President Ziaur Rahman suggested to have a separate banking system for 
      every Islamic country of its own. Earlier, in November 1980, Bangladesh 
      Bank sent a representative to study the working of Islamic banks abroad. 
      In November 1982, IDB came forward to establish a joint venture Islamic 
      bank in the private sector. Two professional bodies, IERB and BIBA made a 
      significant contribution to Islamic banking in the country. They trained 
      up top bankers and economists and held seminars, symposia and workshops to 
      mobilize public opinion for Islamic banking. Their professional activities 
      were reinforced by a number of entrepreneurs who concentrated mainly in 
      mobilizing equity capital for the emerging Islamic bank. At last, the long 
      drawn struggle to establish an Islamic bank in Bangladesh became a reality 
      and Islami Bank Bangladesh Limited was established. Now, there're many 
      Islamic banks, insurance companies and business enterprises around us.

      <b>NN</b>: What is the distinction between Islamic and General Banking?
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 7.5pt 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
      <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times">Mr. Hannan: Islamic Banking is based on 
      Islamic Sahriah and completely free from interest, which is prohibited in 
      Islam and also pursues Islamic socio-economic objectives. But, on the 
      other hand, interest is the main-basis of conventional banks. </span></p>

      people to the Islami Banking system? </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 7.5pt 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
      <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times">Mr. Hannan: It's highly positive. As 
      interest is strictly prohibited in Islam and since most of the people of 
      our country are Muslims and religious, they try their best to get 
      themselves away from any prohibition in Islam. Moreover, Shariah banking 
      system itself is a scientific system. Close supervision over the 
      investment and investment-clients could avoid cropping up of unwanted bad 
      investment, that's a major crisis in our present banking system of the 
      country. Participation in profit instead of interest would give an 
      investment-client a relief from the burden of interest. </span></p>
