      <p align="justify">The world of Islam today is passing through a critical 
      period of its history. We are confronted with many problems and find 
      ourselves in a limbo, between aspirations and despair. We, therefore, need 
      to locate the key problems the Muslim nation(Muslim Ummah) faces today and 
      identify our duties.<br>
      <br>
      If we are really sincere and determined to overcome the problems facing 
      Muslims worldwide, we need cooperation between the different sectors of 
      Muslim societies. What is particularly needed is teamwork and dialogue 
      between the thinkers (Mufakkirs) and traditional religious scholars (Alims 
      – in Arabic pl. Ulama) of Islam. While the Ulama are better versed in the 
      permissibility or forbidden nature of a certain act, the Mufakkirs are 
      advanced in the field of ideas even if they are not fully conversant with 
      Islamic Laws (Shariah) and regulations concerning the various forms of 
      worship. The Mufakkirs deeply contemplate the problems the Muslim Ummah 
      faces today. Hence the Alims need the opinion of the thinkers. The 
      thinkers, on the other hand, require the opinion of the Alims. Dr. 
      Muhammad Iqbal, for instance, is not considered to be an Alim but a 
      Mufakkir of Islam. He was a pioneering thinker of Islam. In a similar 
      vein, Dr. Ali Shariati of Iran was a far greater thinker than many 
      contemporary Alims. Syed Qutb, too, was a remarkable thinker of Islam. He 
      is considered a Mufakkir rather than an Alim. Likewise, Dr. Khurshid Ahmed 
      of Pakistan, Dr. Hasan Zaman, and Dr. Syed Sajjad Husain of Bangladesh are 
      Mufakkirs or thinkers. What we need is an interaction between such 
      thinkers (Mufakkirs) with the traditional<br>
      religious experts (Alims). The Alims will identify the limits of Islam 
      that cannot be crossed in matters of permissibility and prohibition (halal 
      and haram). The Mufakkirs, on the other hand, will try to find solutions 
      within these prescribed limits. At the same time, the Alims must realize 
      that the Mufakkirs have thoroughly studied the outstanding problems 
      plaguing the world today, in their various depths and dimensions. If a 
      synthesis between the expertise of the scholars (Alims) and the ideas of 
      the thinkers (Mufakkirs) can be attained, only then is it possible to 
      arrive at a pragmatic and realistic solution to these problems. We, 
      therefore, need close cooperation and collaboration between these two 
      different and yet interdependent groups of people.<br>
      <br>
      If we really want to serve the cause of Islam in a meaningful way in 
      today’s world, and respond effectively to the ills of our times, we must 
      be aware of contemporary problems. The philosophical problems the earlier 
      Muslim generations faced, notably the conflict between the Mutazilites and 
      the Asharites, which continued for more than two centuries, are no longer 
      relevant today. During the last century, we confronted the ideologies of 
      socialism, capitalism, secularism, and the ideas of Darwin and Freud and 
      these continue to be significant issues until today. Our seminaries (Madrasas), 
      however, continue to teach the philosophy of the Mutazilites and Asharites 
      and other ancient philosophical issues. They do not teach philosophical 
      issues of current significance. The old issues no longer pertain to the 
      world we inhabit today. The literature on such topics can remain in the 
      Madrasa libraries as reference books. Such topics should not be part of 
      the contents of present-day Mardasa text books, which should engage 
      contemporary issues, those<br>
      burning philosophical questions and difficulties of the day mentioned 
      above.<br>
      <br>
      Today, a great deal of change has become apparent in the realm of 
      politics. Parliamentary system has been introduced. The ballots are now 
      being cast in secret. Issues such as those concerning the decentralization 
      of power, federal structure of the government which shares powers with the 
      autonomous units, the delegation of power to regional government, etc. 
      have come to the forefront. These issues and concepts are completely new 
      and therefore not<br>
      discussed in the old books of Fiqh (books on law). The earlier Fiqh books 
      do not contain any discussion, for instance, on election or the separation 
      of power among the three organs of the government as these are also new 
      concepts. Previously the elite used to dominate politics and the public 
      did not play an important role. The situation is quite different today. 
      Today, with the strengthening of civil society, the people play a central 
      role embodied in the elections even<br>
      though the elite continue to play a significant role as well.<br>
      <br>
      Likewise, a good deal of change has taken place in the economic arena. 
      Earlier, concepts like Central Bank, Monetary Policy, Inflation, etc. were 
      absent. If we are not adequately familiar<br>
      with developments in this field, we shall not be able to arrive at the 
      most judicious decisions. Against this backdrop, it is essential to attain 
      knowledge of modern Economics and modern<br>
      Political Science. <br>
      <br>
      Here, we may cite the contributions of the eminent thinker (Mufakkir) Dr. 
      AbdulHamid A. Abu Sulayman, who was Rector of the International Islamic 
      University, Malaysia and now the President of the International Institute 
      of Islamic Thought, USA. He has discussed in great detail the crisis 
      prevalent in the Muslim World. The crisis today has become more critical 
      than it was 10-15 years ago. In his book Crisis in the Muslim Mind, Dr. 
      AbdulHamid opined that a blind imitation of the West is not desirable from 
      an Islamic perspective. This will also not be acceptable to the common 
      Muslim. No nation can become great by emulating others in a wholesale 
      fashion. Such a people cannot become a leading nation in the world.<br>
      <br>
      One view is that we must follow the earlier generations of Mulims, imitate 
      the way the Abbasids and the Umayyads solved their problems, the way 
      jurists (Fuqaha) solved their problems some 1200 years ago. Dr. AbdulHamid 
      argues that this is neither possible nor practical. Many changes have 
      occurred in many spheres of life – in politics, economics, administration 
      and communication- and the solution to today’s shifting problems cannot be 
      found in the practices of the earlier generations or opinions of the 
      Fuqaha of bygone times. He suggests that we must devise fresh solutions to 
      contemporary problems in the light of the Quran and Sunnah. We<br>
      must identify the problems of the Muslim Ummah, evaluate the nature, depth 
      and dimension of each crisis adequately, and then craft solutions while 
      maintaining the centrality of Islamic<br>
      precepts to our considerations. In designing these solutions, we must 
      utilize our intellect and resort to the methodology of Ijtihad. In his 
      seminal book, Dr. AbdulHamid terms this approach,<br>
      which he deems to be the most adequate for tackling contemporary problems, 
      the “Asala approach” or “the original approach.” <br>
      <br>
      I suggest that the ideas of Dr. Abdul Hamid merit serious consideration 
      and implementation. He has underscored the importance of considering the 
      specificities of time and place. With the passage of time, circumstances 
      change, and circumstance or context, is a crucial factor in deciding 
      matters of gravity. We should, therefore, try to find the ruling of the 
      Quran and Sunnah<br>
      on a particular problem or issue giving due importance to issues of time 
      and space.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Abdul Hamid further stressed the importance of rewriting the social 
      sciences in the light of Islam. The subject of reconceptualizing the 
      social sciences did not make much headway and<br>
      progress in the hands of the Muslims. We must develop the social sciences 
      further, taking inspiration from Islamic principles. This requires a 
      serious investment of time and labor on our part. The International 
      Islamic University Malaysia has begun questioning the conventional 
      premises of the social sciences. Other Islamic universities are also 
      committed to revamping or restructuring social scientific thought and 
      approaches.<br>
      <br>
      Bangladesh, today, is facing numerous problems. One of the major problems 
      we face is poverty. The alleviation of poverty is no easy task. Some think 
      that we can ameliorate poverty by simply<br>
      establishing Zakah. However, I feel that this problem is a complex one and 
      requires a complex, multifaceted strategy. In my article ‘Poverty 
      Alleviation: Islamic Perspective,’ I have emphasized that we must 
      simultaneously establish Zakah, restore endowment (Wakf), and utilise 
      monetary and fiscal policy and banking system in a harmonious, 
      well-coordinated manner with the objective of attaining overall economic 
      development. Only such a polyphonic approach can help us combat poverty 
      effectively in today’s world. <br>
      <br>
      Education comes next. This is one of the primary problems plaguing 
      Bangladesh. We must craft an education policy in the light of the basic 
      tenets of Islam. Since the existing educational curriculum fails to meet 
      the requirements of Islam, it must be recast. The Alims should play a 
      constructive and meaningful role in the reform of education in the 
      interest of the nation of Bangladesh. The first step they must take 
      towards undertaking this project is carefully considering the work already 
      done in this field by the International Islamic University in Malaysia, 
      the International Islamic University in Islamabad, Pakistan, and the 
      International Islamic University in Chittagong, Bangladesh. In these seats 
      of learning, students are required to study specialized Islamic courses - 
      notable among them are the Quran, Islamic Studies, Fiqh, Arabic Language, 
      Islamic Economics etc. - along with other modern subjects. The students, 
      thus, acquire a basic knowledge of Islam alongside knowledge of the 
      subjects in their field of specialization. In this way, the existing 
      curriculum is being gradually modified, refined, and restructured. The 
      future curricula of the Muslim World may take shape following the above<br>
      outline in due course. Therefore, we can consider the curriculum of the 
      International Islamic University in Malaysia, the International Islamic 
      University in Islamabad, Pakistan, and the International Islamic 
      University in Chittagong, Bangladesh to constitute models for other 
      institutions of higher education to follow.<br>
      <br>
      The Madrasa (religious schools / colleges of the sub-continent) education 
      will carry great weight only if it plays a meaningful role in preparing 
      people who can effectively administer contemporary civic institutions and 
      the economy. Should we wish to make the Madrasa part of the mainstream 
      general education, we must consider this matter of reforming Madrasa 
      education carefully. The<br>
      students now graduating from the Madrasas are not capable of running 
      either the economic sector or the administrative sector of a country 
      successfully. These students have neither studied Business Administration 
      nor Economics nor Political Science/Government nor Public Administration. 
      We can resolve this problem and improve the situation in the Alia Madrasa 
      (one of the two types of Madrasas in Bangladesh) by introducing three 
      additional options / degrees along with the existing four degrees (Kamils) 
      at the graduation level. Out of the total sixteen years’ curriculum, we 
      can keep the first twelve years curriculum more or less intact and 
      introduce new subjects into the course curriculum for the last four years 
      (Fazil and Kamil courses). The existing degrees of Tafsir, Hadith, Fiqh 
      and Adab may remain. We have to introduce three-four more degrees at the 
      Kamil level (15th and 16th year of study) notably Economics, Business 
      Administration, and Public Administration. This means, in the first twelve 
      years, students will acquire knowledge of Islam in the same way as before 
      and in the later four years they will study<br>
      contemporary subjects such as Economics or Business Administration or 
      Public Administration to fulfil requirements for the Kamil degree. If we 
      can conduct this project of revision successfully,<br>
      the Madarasas should become capable of producing persons skilled in 
      knowledges of both worlds and hence better able to serve their country and 
      the Muslim community.<br>
      <br>
      The Qaumi Madrasas (the Madrasas that follow the Deobond regimen), in the 
      same way, confer degrees on Fiqh, Hadith, Tafsir and Arabic Language, and 
      the degree is called Dawra. We should introduce at least two more Dawras, 
      notably Dawra-e-Iqtesad and Dawra-e-Business<br>
      Administration. The course curriculum of the first twelve years here too 
      may remain unchanged. The new Dawras would be added to the course content 
      for the last four years only. If we are able to introduce these two new 
      subjects in the curriculum of the Qaumi Madrasas, these educational 
      institutions will also produce eminent Alims who shall be simultaneously 
      capable of fulfilling the general economic and administrative needs of the 
      societ. If we can make these changes, we shall be well on our way towards 
      unifying the madrasa and the modern educational systems.<br>
      <br>
      Another problem the Muslim Ummah is facing is that of extremism or 
      radicalism. Islam certainly does not propound the way of extremism, but 
      that of the middle-path or the balanced path<br>
      Some twenty years following the death of Prophet Muhammad (peace and 
      blessings be upon him), the Khawarij emerged as a radical current among 
      the earlier Muslims. Extremist in religious<br>
      belief and political thinking, the Khawarij were rejected by the 
      mainstream of the Ummah. Even today, there are religious groups that adopt 
      extreme views on socio-political and religious issues. <br>
      We must be very cautious about these extremist groups and make Muslims 
      aware of their activities so that the Muslim Ummah may be protected from 
      the negative effects of the extremist approach. Extremism thrives when 
      people become preoccupied with very small matters, minor and side issues, 
      ignoring or neglecting the fundamental issues. Such a problem arises when 
      we fail to derive lessons from history and do not possess sufficient 
      knowledge and understanding of the Shariah and other related subjects. 
      There is no doubt that the welfare of the Ummah lies in avoiding the 
      extreme path. Extremism has led to the suffering of Muslims in different 
      countries around the world.(Reference:Islamic Awakening between Rejection 
      and Extremism by Dr. Qaradawi) <br>
      <br>
      The social condition of women is another key issue. Many eminent Alims and 
      Islamic scholars have spoken about the rights of women. We can mention 
      here the names of a few who have spoken with particular eloquence and 
      insight on this issue, such as Prof. Dr. Yusuf Al Qaradawi, Dean of the 
      Faculty of Shariah, Qatar University; Dr. Jamal A. Badwi, Chairman, 
      Islamic Information Foundation, Canada; Sheikh Abdul Halim Abu Shuqqah, 
      eminent leader of the Ikhwanul Muslimeen (the Muslim Brotherhood of 
      Egypt); Dr. Hasan Turabi, ideologue of the Sudanese Islamic Movement, to 
      name only a few. They have argued that Muslims cannot advance unless women 
      are given the honor and support due to them. It is not possible to make 
      progress leaving behind half of the members of the society. They have 
      therefore stressed the importance of involving women in an entire range of 
      Islamic activities and ensuring that<br>
      the various rights of women are practiced and protected. While women can 
      clearly acquire a great deal of knowledge about Islam through attending 
      mosques, some people continue to debate the rights of women to attend 
      mosques. We should, therefore, try to understand and seriously consider 
      the various problems faced by women today and the Alims should take an 
      initiative in aiding women so that the latter can move forward.<br>
      <br>
      Misinterpretation is another problem looming before us. Large numbers of 
      translations of the Quran and Hadith compilation are available in the 
      market today. Naturally people read them and many questions arise on 
      different issues in the minds of these readers, who then become inclined 
      to respond to these questions themselves even though these readers are not 
      well versed in the underlying principles and and methods of interpretation 
      (Usul). Those who want to judiciously interpret the Quran and Hadith must, 
      therefore, acquire knowledge of the Usul al Fiqh. They have to read books 
      on Usul al Fiqh that are accessible to the lay public. High-quality 
      authentic books on the subject need to be translated in local languages 
      from Arabic and circulated and publicized widely. The teachings of such 
      books must be disseminated to all those who intend to study Islam from the 
      original sources and cultivate the capacity of interpretation. Otherwise, 
      individual efforts to interpret will create confusion within the polity, 
      particularly by those who try to interpret by reading translations alone. 
      The Alims need to pay attention to this matter and help disseminate the 
      knowledge of Usul.<br>
      <br>
      Likewise, we should also try to bring an end to the debate over democracy. 
      We know that there is no place for dictatorship or autocracy or monarchy 
      in Islam. The vast majority of Islamic parties and movements around the 
      world are struggling for democratic rights today. They consider election 
      as the most legitimate instrument to effect changes in government. They 
      demand legal rights so that they can participate in the fruits of civic 
      and political rights. If any restriction is imposed on the functioning of 
      Islamic parties, they turn to the law and file petitions with the Court so 
      that they are allowed to function as a legitimate and law -abiding 
      organization. During the days of unified Pakistan, one political party was 
      banned. That party fought a long legal battle all the way up to the 
      Supreme Court of Pakistan where it won its case. In other words, this 
      Islamic party determinedly sought to secure its democratic right to 
      function as a legal political party.<br>
      <br>
      Islamic parties in different countries are trying to reform the government 
      by participating in democratic elections. All eminent Islamic political 
      scientists think that subject to the sovereignty<br>
      of Allah, democracy constitutes an adequate method for establishing an 
      Islamic state. The modern democratic process, in fact, can be understood 
      to be an elaboration of the principles of Shura and Khilafah. What is the 
      Khilafah? Khilafah means representation. It means a beneficial, 
      consultative government of the people through representation of the 
      Divine. We are all vicegerents (Khalifh) of Allah and must understand that 
      when we talk of democracy, we mean government under the suzerainty of 
      Allah and through consultation with the people. What I am hinting at here 
      is Islamic Democracy. This concept does not cohere completely with the 
      model of Western democracy but the two do have common ground. If this 
      concept is not clarififed, some people are likely to provide opportunities 
      for dictatorial parties to seize power. This will benefit the enemies of 
      Islam. All the Alims of Pakistan supported Fatima Jinnah against the 
      candidacy of Field Marshal Ayub Khan in the 1965 presidential elections on 
      account of her promise to restore democracy. Regrettably, some of us tend 
      to have very short memories indeed and are now adopting extreme positions 
      against the consensus of the Islamic scholars and Alims of the past. Such 
      a move will undoubtedly cause much harm in the long run.<br>
