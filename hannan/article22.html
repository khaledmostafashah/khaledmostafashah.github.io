    <td width="100%"> <p align="justify">Bangladesh started as a democratic state 
        with the introduction of the constitution in 1972. However, there was 
        introduction of democracy in Bangladesh, there were several interruptions 
        of democracy in Bangladesh. Democracy has taken farmer root since 1991 
        When Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed became the Caretaker President of the country. 
        In this period since 1991 three elections were held. One was in 1991, 
        another one in 1996 and the third one was 2001. We have seen three govt. 
        in this period. First govt. was the first Khaleda Zia govt. from 1991-1996, 
        then there was Sheikh Hasina govt. from 1996-2001 and then 2nd Khaleda 
        govt. was from 2001 to till now. Of course in between these govt. there 
        was caretaker govt. lead by former Chief Justice of the country as per 
        our constitution. The first khaleda Zia govt. was proceed by Justice Shahabuddin 
        Ahmed.
      <p>I will discuss in this short essay the basic features of our democracy 
        in the last fourteen years from 1991 to till now and also discuss the 
        core issues before us which call for complementation and solution. We 
        find that the first problem is the influence of money and muscle in elections. 
        It is true that on paper the elections were hold properly. However, wide 
        spread use of money and muscle in the election more sometime less. But 
        in any even there have been use of money and muscle and some how the Election 
        Commission cannot stop it. Election Commission cannot stop the restriction 
        on expenditure. They have been unable to stop these things. So the issue 
        of fair election is a core issue for the country in view of the public 
        perception mentioned above. In this regard, I believe several things required 
        to be done. One is the strengthening the Election Commission and makes 
        it totally independent on the pattern of our neighbor India. What is doubted 
        the neutrality and the independence of Election Commission in India.</p>
      <p>However, in our country we see that there is a kind of tension between 
        the Election Commission and the govt. and there have been several periods 
        in un&#8230;. between the Election Commission and the govt. the composition 
        over its members and chairman and over its independent neutrality. So 
        this issues have to be handled in future. Election Commissioner has to 
        be made independent and the selection of the members of the Election Commission, 
        if possible, should be made with the approval of the major parties of 
        our country. Neutral laws required to be changed in line with India as 
        I mentioned. Like India asset declaration must be made compulsory and 
        the election irregularities if there is any, these should be investigate 
        quickly. Unfortunately now, if there is any complaint of the election 
        about rigging, there are so many stages that the decision is not taken 
        in the five year term. So this encourages muscle power and money power. 
        What is needed is that the complaint should be taken very seriously and 
        the decision must be given within a short time. There should be mandatory 
        time limit at every step and there should not be too many appeals. There 
        should be at the most one appeal or two appeals and in every stage there 
        should be a time limits so that the decision can be given about the irregularity 
        or not within a short time of six months. If this can be done and if ten-twenty 
        members are loose there election then this should be very great lesson 
        for all other members and these irregularities will greatly reduce.</p>
      <p>Now, the next point that I will be mentioned about this period that the 
        caretaker govt. I mean our democracy is in a way regulated by the caretaker 
        govt., the caretaker concept or constitution. This was resulted of lake 
        of faith on the govt. to hold a fair election and this is a general consensus 
        that this good idea and better idea in our country in our context then 
        holding a election under a party govt. So this concept of caretaker govt, 
        has been accepted by the people fully and these should be maintain. And 
        yes, there can be some amendments in proper time, if there is a general 
        agreement among the major political parties on the substance of the amendment. 
        If there is an agreement this can be changed. Otherwise the caretaker 
        provisions should detached and further problem should be created which 
        will be bad for our democracy at this time. </p>
      <p>During this democracy, I will say that this period of 1991 inwards there 
        was, general speaking press freedom rather we can say there was so much 
        press freedom compared to any other country our press is free. What is 
        really needed is that we do not abuse the press freedom and there is genuine 
        neutrality in given new. If this is not done actually we harm democracy. 
        I mean the people concern should understand that we harm democracy and 
        also this is not justice. People have right to know the truth and correct 
        news, not tilted news. Our democracy so far press freedom is concern can 
        be rated the high implementation stage.</p>
      <p>Another features that I wold mentioned in this essay that the politicization 
        of the sub&#8230;. and various appointments of the country. Who ever comes 
        in govt. and by and large, appointment people on those who are unknown 
        to them or who support them. This is not appropriate. This allegation 
        cannot be proved but these are the public perception and this what I find 
        in the market and what hair in the market. I feel this is not to be possible 
        to adduce proves, but that even in appoints of the Public Service Commission 
        (PSC) and such commission the party people or supporter as a party are 
        put is not by any particular govt. by any successive govt. This reach 
        to politicized of the administration and bureaucracy and important appointment. 
        This is should not happen. This has to be rectified, some how public opinion 
        should be created for that.</p>
      <p>Our democracy is also party complicated and frustrated by repeated hartal 
        by party and by also boycott of the parliament by most important part. 
        This is a phenomenon which is peculiar to Bangladesh not find in so much 
        in other countries. A few hartals may be acceptable or may be was acceptable 
        in the past but in my understanding this is no longer acceptable. These 
        ruin us for the economy and the country and this does not help political 
        process. This does not help democracy. This also does not lead to change 
        our govt. and this should not lead to change the govt. So this is very 
        undemocratic step of democratic party. This is ruining the image of the 
        country abroad also. And people are also frustrated. People do not like 
        it.</p>
      <p>So it is the case of the boycott of the parliament. Some boycott contains 
        for months, some for the whole session, some few days. This devastates 
        the prospect of the democracy in the country. In my understand parliaments 
        are boycotted for very small reasons though they make out that these are 
        very big issues. They say these are very big reasons. But I understand 
        that in the total context of politics these are not so big issues. It 
        appears to mean that parties in opposition whoever the party remains wait 
        for an opportunity so that they can come out and get out. So this should 
        not be there. A law in this practice necessary now about hartal. A law 
        is probably necessary banning hartal. Of course debate in parliament &#8211; 
        such a law should in acted and if possible after finding consensus.</p>
      <p>Similarly, I can only request all parties not to boycott parliament particularly 
        its sessions and for long time. They can walkout for one hour or for the 
        day. But it should not be more than that. They should not use the instrument 
        because this reduces the use of parliament, value of parliament. So we 
        must find out a way to avoid it.</p>
      <p>Another point that I must say, law and order problem. This time fifteen 
        years of democracy from 1991, law and order had deteriorated really and 
        the public perception is for this mastan elementst, the party are responsible. 
        This is the public impression. So this requires solution. Best solution 
        is that the big party should throw out all the mastan elements from their 
        party and they should not depend on mastan or noney. They should depend 
        on people for victory of the election and if they don&#8217;t get a victory 
        through public ballot than they should not coming to power. They not need 
        to the govt.</p>
      <p>From the above discussion I wold say that though I have identified five 
        or six things above, but the core issues are probably the behavior of 
        the govt. and the reform of the election. The govt. must behave in a very 
        democratic way particularly or I would say the behavior of the political 
        party not appropriate. This is a major problem. They are in fact, depended 
        on money and muscle and mastan elements. They use the public when they 
        are in govt. They use the laws and forces agencies for their political 
        aim. They have politicize democracy. So the behavior of the govt. is very 
        important. And opposition they should not use hartal and parliament boycott. 
        So the behavior of the govt. and the main opposition is very very important. 
        This is one issue and the second issue is the reform of the election system 
        which I have discussed.<br>
