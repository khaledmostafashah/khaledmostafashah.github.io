      <p align="justify">A new day in the name of Valentine Day (Bhalobasha 
      Dibosh) is being observed in Bangladesh for the last few years. Some 
      papers are encouraging its observance. A group of businessmen and 
      hotel-owners are encouraging it for business gain and profit. What is the 
      history and basis of this Valentine Day. I reproduce below in this regard 
      from the writing of a major Scholar Dr. Khalid Baig. <br>
      <br>
      “Most Muslims who indulge in many alien cultural practices, these days, do 
      not know what they are doing. They are just blind followers of their 
      equally blind cultural leaders. <br>
      <br>
      Little do they realize that what they regard as innocent fun may in fact 
      be rooted in paganism. That the symbols they embrace may be symbols of 
      unbelief. That the ideas they borrow may be products of superstition. And 
      that all these may be a negation of what Islam stands for.<br>
      <br>
      Consider Valentine’s Day, a day that after dying out a well deserved death 
      in most of Europe – but surviving in Britain and the United States – has 
      suddenly started to emerge across a swath of Muslim countries. Who was 
      Valentine? Why is this day observed?<br>
      <br>
      Legends abound, as they do in all such cases, but this much is clear 
      Valentine’s Day began as a pagan ritual started by Romans in the 4th 
      century BCE to honour Lupercus, the ‘god of fertility and flocks’. Its 
      main attraction was a lottery held to distribute young women to young men 
      for ‘entertainment and pleasure’ – until the next year’s lottery.<br>
      <br>
      Among other equally despicable practices associated with this day was the 
      lashing of young women by two young men, clad only in a bit f goatskin and 
      wielding goatskin thongs, who had been smeared with the blood of 
      sacrificial goats and dogs. A lash of the ‘sacred’ thongs by these ‘holy 
      men’ was believed to make the women better able to bear children. <br>
      <br>
      As usual, Christianity tried, unsuccessfully, to stop the evil celebration 
      of Lupercalia. It first replaced the lottery o the names of women with a 
      lottery of the names of saints. The idea was that during the following 
      year the young men would emulate the life of the saint whose name they had 
      drawn. Christianity ended up dong in Rome, and elsewhere, as the Romans 
      did.<br>
      <br>
      The idea that you can preserve the appearance of a popular evil and yet 
      somehow turn it to serve the purpose of virtue has survived……<br>
      <br>
      The only success it had was in changing the name of Lupercalia to St. 
      Valentine’s Day. Pope Gellasius did it in the year 496, in honour of one 
      Saint Valentine. However, there are as many as 50 different Valentines in 
      Christian legends. Two of them are more famous, although their lives and 
      characters are also shrouded in mystery. <br>
      <br>
      According to one legend, which is more in line with the true nature of 
      this celebration, St. Valentine was a ‘lover’s saint’ who had himself 
      fallen in love with his jailer’s daughter.<br>
      <br>
      Due to serious troubles that accompanied such lottery, French government 
      banned the Valentine ritual in 1776. It also vanished over the years in 
      Italy, Austria, Hungry and Germany. Earlier, during the 17th century when 
      the Puritans were strong it had been banned in England, but King Charles 
      II revived it in 1660.<br>
      <br>
      From England the Valentine ritual arrived in the New World, where 
      enterprising Yankees spotted a good means of making money. Esther A 
      Howland who produced, in the 1840s, one of the first commercial American 
      Valentine Day cards called - what else - valentines sold $ 5,000 worth in 
      the first year. (Then $ 5,000 was a lot of money). The valentine industry 
      has been booming ever since.<br>
      <br>
      It is the same story with Halloween, which has otherwise normal human 
      beings dressing, like ghosts and goblins in a re-enactment of an ancient 
      pagan ritual of demon worship.<br>
      <br>
      The pagan name for that event was Samhain (pronounced sow-en). Just as in 
      case of Valentine’s Day. Christianity changed its name, but not the pagan 
      moorings. ……<br>
      <br>
      Even the apparently innocuous celebration might have pagan foundations. 
      According to one account, in pagan curlers, people feared evil spirits, 
      especially on their birthdays. It was a common belief that evil spirits 
      were more dangerous to a person when he or she experienced a change in 
      their daily life, such as turning a year older. So family and friends 
      surrounded the person with laughter and joy on their birthdays to protect 
      them from evil.<br>
      <br>
      How can anyone in his right mind think that Islam would be indifferent to 
      practices steeped in anti-Islamic ideas and beliefs? ….<br>
      <br>
      It is a great tragedy that under the constant barrage of commercial and 
      cultural propaganda from the forces of Jahiliya and the relentless media 
      machine, Muslims have began to embrace the Valentines, the Halloween 
      ghosts, and even Santa Glaus.”-<br>

      <br>
      This is the history of Valentine Day. Such a programme based on paganism 
      and superstition should not be observed in a country like Bangladesh where 
      Muslims constitute ninety percent of the population. Islam has taught us 
      genuine love of all which does not depend on observance of a day of such 
      type. In our country it has become a medium for free mixing of some young 
      people and for adultery. This is no part of culture of the Muslims or the 
      Bangladeshis. Any part of western culture which increases obscenity and 
      indecency should not be allowed in our country. I draw the attention of 
      scholars, journalists, teachers, Imams and social workers to take steps to 
      stop its observance in our country.</td>
