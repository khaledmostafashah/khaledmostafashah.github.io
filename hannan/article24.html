    <td width="100%"> <p align="justify">Right now in August, when I am speaking, 
        the world is going through a tense situation. I find that Israel, fully 
        backed by America, has launched a vicious attack on Palestinian and Lebanese 
        people. I need not go into the history of this problem which is almost 
        well-known now to the people of the world and also our people in Bangladesh 
        and Muslim world. However, I must mention that Israel was created not 
        on the basis of any public opinion of the Palestinians. There was no referendum 
        in Palestine to create Israel. It is not like Indian situation that the 
        Indian subcontinent was divided on the basis of the opinion of the representative 
        parties of the Muslims, the Hindus and the Sikhs, nothing like that happened 
        in Palestine. <br>
        Palestine was an undivided entity. Its people were 85% Muslim, 10% Christian 
        and 5% Jew. Britain was controlling the territory. Britain never held 
        a referendum as we have seen later in east Timor where under United Nation 
        a referendum was held and they said it by majority vote that they wanted 
        to establish an independent state and did not want to remain in Indonesia. 
        Nothing like that happened in Palestine. <br>
        On the basis of certain commitment given by Britain to a section of the 
        leadership of the Jews, what happened finally is that the United Nations 
        passed a resolution creating two entities, one called Israel and the other 
        part was made a part of Jordan. They did not agree to create a single 
        Palestine state. So, the state was created by United Nation in 1948 against 
        the wishes of the Palestinian people. At that time Palestinian main party 
        was Muslim party.By that time lot of Jews have been brought in Israel. 
        It may be by that time Jews have become 15% or little more. But the main 
        party was still the Muslims. They were 75%, Christian 10%. No opinion 
        was taken of the Muslims. All were against it. Not a single Muslim or 
        Christian was in favour of it. So it was imposed. Now Israel is backed 
        by America. At that time Jews were backed by Russia, America, UK, France 
        with all kinds of assistance. They captured more areas than they were 
        allocated. They were allocated about 45%, but they captured about 78% 
        and the rest went to Jordan. Later, after 1967 war, when Israel captured 
        West Bank, Jordan gave-up sovereignty over the West Bank to the Palestinians 
        so that they can establish their state there and in Gaza. <br>
        So it is one of the tragedies of the modern history that such a state 
        was created against the wishes of the people. There was no record like 
        that in the whole human history. In the history also we find a state or 
        province called Palestine, we do not find any state called Israel. The 
        Israelis were Bani Israel, actually not Israel. But they have now created 
        the state and we know the rest of the history how America backed Israel 
        by financial and political support. People ask the question who controls 
        whom? Is it America who controls Israel or is it Israel who controls America? 
        All the time America&#8217;s vetoes are available to protect Israel. So 
        the world is helpless. One veto is sufficient to stop solution. <br>
        So presently, as far as I know from the International reports as I have 
        seen that present situation started when one doctor and his wife were 
        abducted by the Israeli Army and then a Palestinian group (not HAMAS) 
        abducted an Israeli Soldier. Then Israel started bombing not Hamas or 
        not only the so called militants but they started bombing on the power 
        station, bridges, roads . Then Hizbullah joined in this conflict. There 
        are still undecided issues between Hizbullah and Israel. Because part 
        of south Lebanon is still occupied by Israel and there are Lebanese prisoners 
        in the lands of Israel. Hizbullah was all the time telling Israel &#8216;that 
        free the prisoners or otherwise we shall capture one of your solider so 
        that we can exchange them &#8216;. According to Hizbullah they captured 
        them in the southern Lebanon. The story I am reading in the internet. 
        Even if they have captured from Israel, it does not give the Justification 
        that they will start bombing the Lebanese govt. army, Lebanese govt. broadcasting 
        station, into ports, airports, fly -overs in Beirut city. This is an unthinkable 
        barbarism that the United States thinks it is ok.<br>
        But what is the solution ? I do not know. I do not find any immediate 
        solution at all. I do not really see any solution. No solution for about 
        50 years because of United States of America and its VETO. This type of 
        VETO is obstacle to peace. Reform of UN and the VETO system is a must. 
        We have seen how by VETO power US has blocked peace and cease -fire initiatives.<br>
        What can be a line of solution? I think the best solution would have been 
        (which people do not like to say now) is to create a single Palestinian 
        state and the Jews who came from outside should go back to their countries. 
        Only those Jews who are Arabs, who are born in Arab lands and the Muslims, 
        the Christians who are original inhabitants should remain. It should be 
        fully democratic, protector of the Human rights of all citizens, the Muslims, 
        Jews, Christians. This is the best solution. But as the Palestinians have 
        agreed and the Arab states by and large have agreed to a 2-state solution 
        to bury the conflict, it is Ok, if this is done quickly. Israel will retain 
        pre-1967 border and the Palestinians will have their state in the rest 
        of the land, about 22 percent. They have prepared themselves to forget 
        the painful history and illegal occupation. <br>
        It can be a solution. But I think United Nation and USA should also give 
        a time limit that within next two years Israel withdraws and if they want 
        then there can be a wall in the boarder, no problem.. There should be 
        a time bound solution. . I think gradually the Palestinians are also thinking 
        they can not get their state and they are thinking of going back to their 
        original position, one Palestine state, where every Jew will be safe .Some 
        foreign Jews may remain, something they will negotiate. But the idea is 
        gaining ground that if two-states solution does not come then we shall 
        have only one state call Palestine. Because the original land is known 
        as Philistine, even Bible has said it is Palestine not Israel. <br>
        By and large, western media has never been sensible in the matter of Palestine. 
        Most of them have always taken a line, a position in favor of Israel. 
        They have never gone all out against Israeli wars, incursions or occupations 
        (except honorable exceptions). They have never said that either solve 
        it within two years or get out. They have never said like that. But no 
        western govt or media has taken this position. The Jewish lobby is very 
        strong in Banking, media, in TV channel.<br>
        I really do not see any solution in the near future, despite what I have 
        written above. So the Muslims should prepare for a long wait and a long 
        battle, not really only military, but essentially an economic, political 
        and diplomatic battle. <br>
        The Muslim and the whole world have suffered a lot. It may lead to big 
        war involving Iraq, Iran, Syria, Jordan and even Egypt. We never know 
        what happens. If something very bad happens, Egypt has to say that it 
        will withdraw its Ambassador. Something very serious may happen. In that 
        case the Arab people will force their governments to withdraw their Ambassador, 
        to go back to their original position. So all these may happen. I think, 
        I can only ask the Muslims that they should be ready for a long wait. 
        They should be stronger economically, militarily, politically. The Muslim 
        world must be democratic so that the West may not argue about corrupt 
        and un-elected governments. We should have proper human rights. We should 
        build up our economy and defense also. This also shows why Muslims should 
        have nuclear power. I think it is necessary that few other states should 
        have nuclear power, Egypt and/or Iran should have nuclear power. If Israel 
        forsakes nuclear power then I agree it is better not to have nuclear power.
