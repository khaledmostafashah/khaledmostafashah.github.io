      </span>Zakat is liable to be collected by force like tax, if the payer 
      does not pay it willingly. This position is applicable where the state 
      compulsorily collects Zakat, and in modern days, has legislated 
      accordingly. The Quran and the Sunnah make it very clear that it is the 
      obligation of an Islamic state&nbsp; which follows Islam to collect Zakat. An 
      important proof in this regard is the decision of Hazrat Abu Bakr (R.A.), 
      the first head of the state of the Islamic Khilafat, to wage war against 
      those who denied to pay Zakat&nbsp; to the state.</span><a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><b><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 15.0pt"><![if !supportFootnotes]><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 15.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[v]</span><![endif]></span></b></span></a><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt">

      </span>Zakat collected in an Islamic state has to be kept in the state 
      Treasury,&nbsp; in a separate account, like tax. Zakat is collected by the 
      state through Zakat officials (Amelina Alaiha). However, if Zakat is 
      collected by Non-government organizations or communities, these should be 
      kept safely as in the case of any public fund. </span></p>

      </span>Zakat, like tax, is paid though there is no direct and equivalent 
      economic benefit is obtained by the payer This is a&nbsp; different matter that 
      Zakat payer expects return in the life hereafter and the tax payer may 
      receive some service from the state in return but there is no direct 
      co-relation</span></p>

      </span>There are also important conceptual and other differences between 
      Zakat and Tax. Primarily, Zakat is an Ibadah (act of worship) which Allah&nbsp; 
      has made compulsory on human being, to express gratitude to Him and to 
      obtain His nearness (Taqwa). Tax is not&nbsp; the same thing as Zakat. Tax&nbsp; is 
      a social obligation without having&nbsp; special sense of gratitude to Allah or 
      to obtain nearness to Allah while&nbsp; Zakat is essentially a matter between 
      Allah and His servants, but tax has been primarily a matter between 
      citizens and the state authorities.. </span></p>

      </span>Zakat is based on Nisab, any wealth below a limit&nbsp; is exempted from 
      Zakat. This is not true in case of many taxes in modern times. Concept of 
      exemption is there in case of tax but it is&nbsp; applicable only when and 
      where the Government or Tax authorities specifically prescribe.</span></p>

      </span>Zakat is a permanent and regular system.&nbsp; None can change it in any 
      way.&nbsp; On the contrary, most of the taxes&nbsp; undergo change from time to 
      time. </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:-.5in">
      <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt">There is difference in the 
      objective and intent between Zakat and Tax. As Allah has said, </span></p>

      them. Your Prayer (for them) is a source of&nbsp; comfort for them. Allah is

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
      <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt">The intent of Zakat is to 
      make wealth pure ( in moral sense) and cleanse the heart of human beings 
      from greed and hoarding. The object of Zakat is spiritual as well as 
      economic. But the object of&nbsp; tax&nbsp; is much more mundane and worldly. Tax 
      could never achieve the moral and spiritual objectives of Zakat in any 
      time of history.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
      <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt">There is difference between 
      Zakat and tax in respect of the utilisation of respective fund whereas tax 
      can be spent for any purpose.&nbsp; Zakat is meant to be spent for specified 
      objectives which are mainly provision for the poor (poverty alleviation), 
      to free debtors from the debt,&nbsp; to free the people in bondage, for&nbsp; the 
      way farer and for the good of the people&nbsp; i.e. Fi Sabi Lillah.</span><a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><b><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 14.0pt"><![if !supportFootnotes]><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[vi]</span><![endif]></span></b></span></a></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
      <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Whatever were the differences 
      in the early writings of Fuquaha (Jurists) of Islam in early period of 
      Islam, there is no serious disagreement among the Fuquaha or Islamic 
      Economists of the current time, as regards of the legality of imposition 
      of taxes in addition to Zakat. Rather a consensus is likely to be 
      prevalent in this regard. Current writings of Islamic Economists, Fuquaha 
      and&nbsp; recent books of Fatwa of the competent Ulama justify this view.

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:3.0pt;text-align:justify">
      <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Dr Yusuf Al-Qaradawi in his 
      monumental work Fiqh-uz-Zakat (Law of Zakat) has given the following 
      arguements in favour of imposition of Taxes by Islamic states, if needed 
      :&nbsp; </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:3.0pt;text-align:justify"><i>
      <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Firstly, </span></i>
      <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt">in his chapter on &quot;whether 
      there is right on wealth other than Zakat&quot;, it has been stated that 
      jurists have, by and large, agreed on this point that in the case of 
      genuine need for Muslims, tax can be imposed even after Zakat.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><i>
      <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Secondly</span></i><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt">, 
      there are needs which cannot be met by Zakat resources&nbsp; i.e. running of 
      general administration,&nbsp; national infrastructure building and so on. This 
      requires imposition of taxes beyond Zakat. Jurists are on the opinion 
      that&nbsp; &quot;which is necessary to complete wajib is wajib (obligatory).</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><i>
      <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Thirdly,</span></i><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt"> 
      general principle of Fiqh is that &quot;avoidance of damage will get priority 
      over doing of good&quot;. If proper economic duties are not performed by the 
      state due to lack of resources, this will lead to serious public 
      dissatisfaction and create violent situation. As such, the state has to 
      obtain&nbsp; required amount of resources through taxes for carrying&nbsp; out its 
      duties</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><i>
      <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Fourthly</span></i><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt">, 
      Allah has made it obligatory to carry out Jihad (defence of Islam and 
      Islamic territory and to put an end to oppression anywhere in this world) 
      through employing one's life and wealth.</span><a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><b><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 14.0pt"><![if !supportFootnotes]><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[vii]</span><![endif]></span></b></span></a><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt"> 
      This is a duty beyond Zakat.&nbsp; To carry out a major Jihad in this age, if

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
      <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Al-Qardawi&nbsp; also mentions 
      that evidence against taxes beyond Zakat from the Hadith are either weak 
      or not unequivocal, whereas the evidence in support of dues&nbsp; other&nbsp; than 
      Zakat from the Quran and Sunnah are very strong.</span><a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><b><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 15.0pt"><![if !supportFootnotes]><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 15.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[viii]</span><![endif]></span></b></span></a><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;

      <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt">There is also consensus among 
      scholars now a days, that&nbsp; even if people pay other taxes, the obligation 
      of payment of Zakat does not lapse. Zakat has been made compulsory, in 
      part, on the Muslim citizen in Pakistan, through promulgation of&nbsp; <b><i>
      Zakat and Ushr Ordinance</i></b>,even&nbsp; though the Muslim citizens pay 
      other taxes such as Income tax, sales tax,&nbsp; import tax. However, Zakat 
      paid is&nbsp; deducted from total income&nbsp; liable to income taxation.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
      <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt">The same provision has been 
      made in Zakat Ordinance of Bangladesh though Zakat payment here is optimal 
      .&nbsp; The Ordinance and the rules made thereunder provide for the items 
      liable to Zakat, Nisab thereof and the rates of Zakat.&nbsp; The Zakat rules of 
      Bangladesh is given in Appendix-A . In Bangladesh also, Zakat Payment does 
      not mean that the payer can escape other taxes</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
      <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt">There is no reason why other 
      taxes would not be paid if Zakat is paid, because the purpose of Zakat 
      levy and the purpose of taxation, as discussed before in the paper, are 
      very different. Zakat can not meet the need of general revenue.</span></p>

      social welfare. &nbsp; </span></p>

      <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt">It is not necessary to levy 
      special tax on the non-Muslims. As long as the non-Muslims pay taxes like 
      Income tax, Customs duties, Value Added Tax,etc. as token of their

      major objectives of Zakat is poverty alleviation. The issue is, can Zakat 
      be spent on Non-Muslims for this purpose. Though a number of Jurists have 
      viewed that Zakat can be spent on non-Muslims, the majurity view is that 
      for poverty alleviation of Non-Muslims&nbsp; non-Zakat resources should be 
      spent. There is no disagreement on the point that poverty alleviation and
