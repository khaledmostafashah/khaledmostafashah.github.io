    <td width="100%"> <p align="justify">The Madrasas in present-day South Asia 
        are bearers of the remarkable revival that Islamic religious education 
        witnessed in colonial India during the late nineteenth century. This renewal 
        began in particular earnestness with the establishment of the Dar-ul-Uloom 
        Madrasa at Deoband in 1867. However, women were not part of this revivalist 
        project in formal religious education, although on the level of informal 
        religious education, they were taken into serious consideration by some 
        Ulama who sought to promote individual piety, to re-Islamize household 
        rituals and daily cultural practices, and to facilitate individual knowledge 
        and observance of Qur&#8217;an- and Hadith-based religious injunctions 
        as opposed to folk customs (Gail Minault, 1998, Secluded Scholars: Women&#8217;s 
        Education and Muslim Social Reform in Colonial India, Oxford University 
        Press). One of the most well known among these reformist Ulama who showed 
        significant concern for enhancing women&#8217;s informal/household religious 
        knowledge in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was the 
        Deoband Madrasa-trained scholar Maulana Ashraf Ali Thanavi (1864-1943). 
        His encyclopedic work, Bihishti Zewar (The Ornaments of Paradise), was 
        primarily aimed at women (although Maulana Thanavi strongly encouraged 
        men to follow it as well) and contained a vast amount of extremely detailed 
        religious prescriptions for conducting numerous daily religious and household 
        activities and for purifying bodily, mental, and emotional states. Maulana 
        Thanavi&#8217;s emphasis on both Muslim men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s 
        EQUAL obligations to seek knowledge and education was remarkably egalitarian 
        for contemporary society, particularly the then worldview of many Indian 
        Ulama and the Muslim elite (Barbara Metcalf, 1982, &#8220;Islamic Reform 
        and Islamic Women: Maulana Thanawi&#8217;s Jewelry of Paradise&#8221; 
        in Moral Conducted and Authority, edited by Barbara Metcalf, pp. 184-95).<br>
        <br>
        However, despite Maulana Thanavi&#8217;s reformist emphasis on the egalitarian 
        message of Islam, like most Ulama of his time and of many many decades 
        later, the Maulana was opposed to women&#8217;s access to public space 
        and possibly could not therefore imagine women&#8217;s access to even 
        the most basic levels of Madrasa education, let alone women&#8217;s access 
        to higher levels of formal religious scholarly capacities. <br>
        <br>
        The historical neglect of women&#8217;s formal religious education continues 
        to shape the sphere of women&#8217;s access to religious scholarship in 
        present-day South Asia, even though some changes are under way in the 
        margins. The neglect of women&#8217;s religious education in South Asia 
        (and possibly elsewhere) is evident today not only in the abysmal gaps 
        between the numbers of male and female Madrasa students and traditional 
        religious scholars but also in the dearth of scholarship on women&#8217;s 
        Madrasas in South Asia. Thus, for instance, neither of the two most comprehensive, 
        recent, and otherwise illuminating and timely scholarly articles on Madrasas 
        in South Asia (see Mumtaz Ahmad&#8217;s and Yogi Sikand&#8217;s respective 
        chapters in Religious Radicalism and Security in South Asia, eds. Satu 
        Limaye et al, Honolulu, Hawaii University Press, 2004) mentions female 
        Madrasa students women even in passing. This essay will briefly discuss 
        and analyze the current situation of religious education of Muslim women 
        in Bangladesh and adjacent areas from a historical perspective. <br>
        <br>
        Gaps Between Islamic Canonical Teachings and Muslim Historical and Cultural 
        Practices<br>
        <br>
        Even though Islam has emphasized access to knowledge for all, the education 
        of Muslim girls and women, particularly in the areas of religious scholarship 
        and authoritative expertise, has been seriously marginalized in most parts 
        of the Muslim world historically. The Prophet of Islam (sm) said that, 
        &#8220;Securing education is an obligation for all Muslims (&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;).&#8221; 
        The Quran has emphasized education unequivocally. The revelation even 
        began with the word &#8216;Iqra&#8217; meaning read, recite.(Quran:96:1) 
        The Quran asks &#8220;Are those who know and who do not know equal?&#8221; 
        (Sura Zumar, Ayat 9) <br>
        <br>
        The Muslim community failed to implement its obligation to educate all 
        its members, male and female. Studies of the Muslim history of various 
        countries reveal that in the establishment of educational institutions, 
        equal opportunities were not created for boys and girls. Of course, rudimentary 
        religious education was imparted to all at home, such as recitation of 
        the Quran, the formal and technical rules of Salat and Siam, and fundamental 
        religious values of modesty, honesty, respect for elders (adab), duties 
        towards one&#8217;s parents, etcetera. But higher education and the realm 
        of religious scholarship and authority became the preserves of men alone. 
        Furthermore, despite the Qur&#8217;anic emphasis on the equality of all 
        human beings and on the Prophetic stress on access to knowledge for all, 
        discriminatory practices were found even with regard to men, let alone 
        women. Thus, prior to the nineteenth century, access to Madrasa teaching 
        and education was largely restricted to the communities of elite Muslims&#8212;the 
        ashraf nobility who were mostly migrants from Central Asia, Iran, and 
        Arabia, and their descendents. The indigenous Muslims&#8212;the ajlaf&#8212;were 
        expected to remain satisfied with the most elementary knowledge of Islam 
        (Yogi Sikand, 2004, &#8220; Reforming the Indian Madrassas: Contemporary 
        Muslim Voices&#8221; in Religious Radicalism and Security in South Asia: 
        120). <br>
        <br>
        However, sociopolitical changes began to sweep across the Muslim world 
        during the 19th and 20th centuries. With the establishment of British 
        colonialism, the Dar-ul-Uloom Madrasa at Deoband was established in 1865. 
        This remains the largest traditional Madrasa in South Asia till this day. 
        In the absence of Muslim rulers as patrons of Madrasa education, and concerned 
        with the threat colonialism and intensifying Christian missionary work 
        in the region posed to the production, sustenance, and enhancement of 
        Islamic knowledge and sensibilities, Ulamas began to establish small and 
        large Madrasas which increasingly turned to the ranks of ordinary ajlaf 
        Muslims, with whom Ulamas and Madrasas had had little contact until then. 
        The ordinary Muslim came to symbolize the survival and well-being of Islam 
        and to serve as the repository of Islamic knowledge and moral reform. 
        In the wake of these changes, Muslim girls did not remain untouched by 
        such reforms for too long. But it would not be till the late nineteenth 
        century and early twentieth century that Muslim girls began to gain access 
        to higher education. At least, this was the case in former Bengal.<br>
        <br>
        Women&#8217;s Religious and Formal Education in Bengal<br>
        The eminent lady who played the greatest role in mobilizing for formal 
        and higher education for women in Bengal specifically, was Begum Rokeya 
        Sakhawat Hussein, who against numerous personal/familial, cultural, and 
        financial odds, established an Urdu-medium school for girls in Calcutta 
        in the year 1911; by then Urdu had come to dominate the elite Muslim culture 
        in Bengal, to be gradually replaced by Bengali in later decades. Named 
        the &#8220;Sakhawat Memorial Girls&#8217; School,&#8221; this school opened 
        at 13 Waliulla Lane in a tiny classroom, with only 8 girls in attendance. 
        In 1917, it became a middle English school. Begum Rokeya added a class 
        every year till her school became a high school in 1931 (Sonia Nishat 
        Amin, 1996, The World of Muslim Women in Colonial Bengal 1876-1939, E. 
        J. Brill, pp. 156-7).<br>
        <br>
        While this was the first stable beginning of modern education among Muslim 
        girls in this region, there were other and even earlier efforts in various 
        parts of Bengal and in certain parts of India to make modern education 
        accessible to girls. Thus, for instance, a primary school for girls from 
        strictly purdah observing families were founded in 1873 in Comilla by 
        another pioneering Bengali woman, Nawab Faizunnessa Chaudhurani who herself 
        had received a good education at home in Urdu, Bengali, Sanskrit, and 
        Persian. This school became a Junior High School (till the 8th grade) 
        in 1889 and a regular High School in 1931. It operates today as Nawab 
        Faizunnesa High School for Girls (Amin 1996: 149-50). In 1897, on the 
        request of Nawab Shamsi Jahan Firdaus Mahal of Murshidabad, Lady Mckenzie, 
        the wife of the governor of Calcutta, Muslim Girls&#8217; Madrasa was 
        inaugurated at Calcutta. Begum Firdaus Mahal funded the construction of 
        the building. She also provided a monthly grant of Rs. 150 while Nawab 
        Ahsanullah of Dhaka contributed Rs. 1000. In 1898, 46 girls enrolled at 
        the Madrasa (Amin 1996: 147). However, not much is known about the exact 
        contents of the Madrasa curriculum. The firs formal school for girls in 
        Dhaka, Eden Female School, was established in June 1878. This was the 
        first government secondary school for girls in the region and remained 
        thus for many years. A college section was introduced in 1926, making 
        the Eden Girls&#8217; School and College the first institute for higher 
        secondary education for women in Eastern Bengal (Amin 1996: 151-3).<br>
        <br>
        However, there was no effort in the area of Bengal to create opportunities 
        for women to obtain higher RELIGIOUS education. Women traditionally received 
        some basic Islamic education at home. In certain ashraf or upper aristocratic 
        families, the quality of Islamic education that girls received at home 
        could be quite remarkable and as high as the quality of the education 
        received by the boys in those families. In many middle and upper class 
        families, a girl would be introduced to the Qur&#8217;an at the age of 
        5 through a lesson in Arabic letters taught by female tutors from modest 
        backgrounds called &#8220;ustadnis.&#8221; These female tutors would also 
        teach some Persian, Urdu, some basic accounting skills, a little sewing 
        and embroidery, and later Bengali and English as well (Amin 1996: 136). 
        Once women began to attend non-religious public schools, they began to 
        be instructed in subjects such as mathematics, history, and geography, 
        but some basic religious instruction continues to this present day in 
        the form of the course &#8220;Islamiyat,&#8221; which is a compulsory 
        course for Muslims in state schools in Bangladesh. However, a Muslim woman 
        did not have any opportunity to become an Alim (religious scholar) through 
        education at an elite Madrasa (a religious seminary with 16 years of coursework 
        and training).<br>
        <br>
        Only during the last 2-3 decades did the Ulama finally open the doors 
        of formal, elite Madrasas to women. Separate women&#8217;s Madrasas, both 
        of the Kamil/Alia variety (that is the Madrasas which follow the govt. 
        approved course curriculum of a few modern subjects and a revised form 
        of the Dars Nizami syllabus) and the Kaumi variety (which follow the Deoband 
        and most traditional/standard Dars Nizami) have been established. However, 
        as far as traditional Islamic courses are concerned, the courses are essentially 
        the same in both the Kamil/Alia and Kaumi systems of religious education. 
        The Kawmi Madrasas are private. They do not receive any financial support 
        from the government and are supported by religious endowments or by zakat 
        and sadaqa. While most of the Alia Madrasas, except the five fully state 
        controlled major Ali Madrasas, are privately owned and administered, the 
        Government of Bangladesh pays 80 percent of the salaries of their teachers 
        and administrators. To varying extents, Madrasa education, by virtue of 
        its charitable spirit and affordability, has made possible some degree 
        of social mobility for thousands of lower and lower middle class people 
        throughout modern South Asia (Mumtaz Ahmad, 2004, &#8220;Madrassa Education 
        in Pakistan and Bangladesh&#8221; in Religious Radicalism and Security 
        in South Asia). <br>
        <br>
        The number of Madrasas for girls which followed Alia courses (in 2005) 
        is as follows:<br>
        <br>
        Level Course Duration Numbers<br>
        Dakhil 10 yrs 952<br>
        Alim 12 years 77<br>
        Fazil 14 years 22<br>
        Kamil 16 years 5<br>
        <br>
        (Source: Dr. Muhammad Abdus Satter, senior official of Madrasah Education 
        Board and author of Bangladesh Madrasah Shikkha (Madrasah Education in 
        Bangladesh), published by the Islamic Foundation Bangladesh).<br>
        <br>
        There are several Kawmi Madrasas for girls. In Dhaka, there are 2 such 
        Madrasas which award the Dawra degree to girls. Dawra degrre is the highest 
        degrree in Qaumi Madrasah and this degree is equivalent to Kamil in Alia 
        Madrasas and Masters in the universities . The students go through 16 
        years study to get this degree. <br>
        <br>
        The course syllabi used in girls/boys Madrasahs in both Alia and Kawmi 
        systems are the same. There is a shortage of female teachers. However, 
        the problem is not a serious one since male teachers in many cases teach 
        in these Madrasas. Male and female Alims tend to be equal in knowledge 
        and abilities. In fact, a senior Alim, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad informed 
        me that the girls tend to perform better as students than the boys since 
        the former appear to take their school duties more seriously. In my view, 
        women Alims can be deployed, as in Turkey, as Muftis wherever their services 
        are required. However, it must be stated that as things stand currently, 
        in order to be compatible with present socioeconomic demands, the Madrasa 
        curriculum requires significant improvement and diversification in coursework, 
        while sustaining a focus on the core religious courses. A serious inclusion 
        of modern disciplines would not only help bridge increasing gaps between 
        Madrasa-educated and lay-educated Muslims but would also help produce 
        Muslims who are religious scholars, able to effectively administer the 
        increasingly diversifying and specialized public and private sectors, 
        and able to establish needed dialogues both within the Muslim community 
        and between Muslims and non-Muslims of different faiths and persuasions. 
        A Muslim, educated in this manner, would truly embody the Islamic ideal 
        of a comprehensive person and system where any separation of one area 
        of life (such as &#8220;religion&#8221;) from another (such as &#8220;politics&#8221; 
        or &#8220;economy&#8221; or &#8220;society&#8221; or &#8220;culture&#8221; 
        of &#8220;education&#8221;) is not recognized. Every dimension exists 
        as a part of a whole just as every organ and part of a human body operates 
        as an integral part of a whole.<br>
        <br>
        Madrasa Education in Bangladesh <br>
        <br>
        Let me briefly discuss the development of Madrasa education in the Bangladesh 
        region over the last 200 years. Warren Hastings, the Governor General 
        of British India,on the request made by the Muslims in 1780, asked Maulana 
        Majduddin, an accomplished scholar of the traditional Islamic Sciences 
        to prepare a course curriculum and to launch a Madrasa. The Madrasa took 
        off in 1780 according to a variant of the Dars Nizamia curriculum. This 
        curriculum, which historically served as a model for many Madrasas throughout 
        the world, was developed in its original form for the Nizamia Madrasa 
        in Baghadad, founded by the eleventh century Seljuq Vizier Nizam-ul Mulk 
        Hasan ibn &#8216;Ali during the Abbasid period. The 1780 Madrasa in Bengal 
        was launched in a rented building in Kolkata (Calcutta). The original 
        Nizamia syllabus had represented a blend of naqli &#8216;uloom (revealed 
        sciences), including the Quran, the hadith, fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) 
        and tafsir(Quranic commentary), on the one hand, and the aqli &#8216;ulum(rational 
        sciences), including Arabic language, grammar, logic, rhetoric, philosophy, 
        astronomy, medicine, physics and mathematics, on the other. However, the 
        Nizami syllabus, as adopted in colonial South Asia and as shaped by cultural 
        and political forces, came to distinguish between &#8220;religious&#8221; 
        and &#8220;worldly&#8221; knowledge and to stress the &#8220;deenie&#8221; 
        sphere of knowledge to the neglect and virtual exclusion (until very recent 
        decades) of areas of modern &#8220;duniyavi&#8221; knowledge (Sikand 2004). 
        Thus the first Madrasa in Bengal followed traditional courses in Arabic 
        grammar, Arabic language, philosophy, logic, Fiqh, usul-al-fiqh, theology 
        (kalam), Tafsir, and Hadith, all largely based on classical texts. This 
        was the beginning of the Alia Madrasa system (Dr. Muhmmad Abdus Satter, 
        2004, Bangladesh Madrasa Shikkha [Madrasa Education in Bangladesh], Islamic 
        Foundation Bangladesh, 1st edition, pp. 120-129). <br>
        <br>
        Many commissions and committees have been formed since then to deal with 
        the various aspects of public education and Madrasa education, but the 
        courses basically remained the same and the Madrasa text books in Fiqh, 
        Usul-al-Fiqh, Tafsir and Hadith have all remained essentially the same. 
        Virtually no significant changes have been effected with the passage of 
        time and significant shifts in socio-political and economic conditions 
        both locally and globally. Contemporary texts and disciplines have not 
        been included in any significant way in the Madrasa curriculum although 
        the subjects of English, Science, Bangla, History, Geography, and Mathematics 
        have been included in the lower stages of Madrasa education (Dr. AKM Azharul 
        Islam and Professor Shah Muhammad Habibur Rahman, Bangladesh School and 
        Madrasa Shikkhaniti o Karjokrom [Curriculum and Education Policy of Schools 
        and Madrasas of Bangladesh], The Islamic Academy, Cambridge, UK, Chapter 
        4). Thus, for instance, texts used for the core religious subjects date 
        back to the seventeenth century at the latest and the eleventh century 
        at the earliest. However, this Alia system of Madrasa education in Bangladesh 
        is quite unique in its five distinct sub-divisions: ibtedai (elementary), 
        dakhil (secondary), alim (higher secondary), fazil (B.A.), and kamil (M.A.) 
        (Mumtaz Ahmad, 2004, &#8220;Madrassa Education in Pakistan and Bangladesh&#8221; 
        in Religious Radicalism and Security in South Asia). <br>
        <br>
        Until recent decades, we find Madasa education in Bangladesh and possibly 
        in South Asia to be characterized by the following features: <br>
        <br>
        1. The method of instruction was Urdu.<br>
        <br>
        2. No reference whatsoever is made to female education.<br>
        <br>
        3. Strict dependence on extremely dated and classical texts. <br>
        <br>
        4. Initially separate books were prescribed in Fiqh, Usul al Fiqh and 
        Kalam for Sunni and Shia students even though these students used to study 
        in the same Madrasa (Dr. Muhammad Abdus Satter, ibid, pages 172-199.).<br>
        <br>
        However, as I said before, the Ulama in the course of the last 20-25 years 
        have become aware of the need of higher religious education for women. 
        Below, I note some of the figures related to the female student community 
        following the Alia system of religious education:<br>

      <p align="justify"> Now I turn to the Islamic Studies Department in colleges 
        and universities. This degree is open to both men and women. The course 
        curriculum has been patterned on the key elements of the syllabus followed 
        at the Dars Nizami Madrasas, where the subjects taught include Arabic, 
        Fiqh, Usul al Fiqh and Hadith, history, and Islamic Philosophy. However, 
        the course coverage of the Islamic traditional sciences is less here than 
        in the Kamil or Dawrah Madrasa courses. A serious student can develop 
        into an Alim if he or she undertakes advanced personal study. However, 
        my conversations with scholars revealed that completion of the Islamic 
        Studies course currently prevalent in the universities can hardly be said 
        to transform one into an Alim (This is the opinion of Prof. Mustafizur 
        Rahman of Dhaka university, Arabic Department, a former Vice-Chancellor 
        of Islamic University, Kushtia, and Nasima Hasan,an M.S. in Islamic Studies 
        from Dhaka University, now a teacher at the International Islamic University, 
        Chittagong, Dhaka Campus).<br>
        <br>
        Let me add that in recent times, some women are taking part in television 
        programs in Bangladesh. These women are largely university educated and 
        trained in general subjects, but have pursued the informal study of Islam 
        on a personal level. A few hold degrees in Islamic Studies or Arabic. 
        The emergence of modern, self-styled religious thinkers or scholars, who 
        secure religious knowledge through informal and personal or Islamic organizational 
        study of Islam, is evident throughout Muslim communities today notably 
        in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. This culture of self-styled 
        religious authority is particularly evident in the sphere of electronic 
        communication. This phenomenon speaks to the gaps in traditional religious 
        education and to the inability of many traditional religious experts to 
        respond satisfactorily to the issues increasingly central to the experiences 
        and needs of younger generations of non-Madrasa educated Muslims in the 
        present-day world.<br>
        <br>
        In conclusion, I will say that Islamic education among women is increasing 
        and diversifying both at informal and formal levels even though the standard 
        of religious education in most of these cases leaves much to be desired. 
        Most female students of religious scholarship today are becoming traditional 
        Alims, as deficient as male Alims in responding to the needs of the rapidly 
        growing numbers of Muslim recipients of modern/non-religious mass higher 
        education, those ranks of Muslims from which the leaders of contemporary 
        Muslim societies and states continue to emerge. Voices for reforming the 
        Madrasa system grow stronger every year and these voices are diverse, 
        but the pace of any real reform has been painfully slow for a number of 
        reasons that scholars have discussed (see, for instance, Yogi Sikand in 
        Religious Radicalism and Security in South Asia, 2004). <br>
        <br>
        The atmosphere of distrust created by the US-led war against &#8220;terrorism&#8221; 
        is certainly not helping the cause of Madrasa reform since many orthodox 
        ulama, who have always resisted reform, now feel more certain than ever 
        that under the guise of liberalizing and modernizing Islamic education, 
        the West and its secular allies are bent on gradually eradicating the 
        force of Islam altogether from the educational and cultural spheres. However, 
        I feel that despite various difficulties and legitimate doubts and concerns, 
        Muslims must move beyond a RE-ACTIVE politics which is often unproductive 
        and harms Muslim interests in the end. While one must learn from history 
        and study it carefully, one should not be determined by it. Muslims and 
        the Ulama in particular, must become PRO-ACTIVE instead and take whatever 
        initiatives necessary to sustain, improve, and enhance Islamic education 
        such that it impacts life positively all over the world, not only in Mulim 
        majority societies. The Qur&#8217;an, after all, was revealed as guidance 
        not only for Muslims, but for &#8220;humankind.&#8221; We should not allow 
        our fear of the uncertainties of the future and the formidable strength 
        and ploys of our adversaries to prevent us from determining, with clarity, 
        the priorities of the Muslim ummah, however diversely constituted. We 
        allowed colonialism to paralyze our advancement for many precious decades. 
        It is no secret, for example, that nineteenth and twentieth century nationalist 
        efforts to define Indian women strictly in terms of the domestic sphere 
        were in large part a reaction to the colonial project of domination and 
        imposed transformation in the Indian subcontinent. Today, we must not 
        allow the current age of imperialism or neo-colonialism to freeze our 
        progress as Muslims for the next hundred years. If Madrasa reforms are 
        undertaken effectively, substantially, and thoughtfully, with an emphasis 
        on the OVERALL kind of Muslim person, scholar, scientist, and leader we 
        want to produce for the twenty-first century and beyond, then it is my 
        belief that both men and women of this generation and the generations 
        to come would benefit from these reforms immensely.</td>
