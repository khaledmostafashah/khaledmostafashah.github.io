      <p align="justify">Islamic Education Movement, which is otherwise widely 
      known as the Movement for the Islamization of Knowledge, as a new 
      phenomenon started its journey sometimes in 1977-1978. A group of scholars 
      thought that the educational system in the Muslim World is not fulfilling 
      the needs of the Muslim countries and that it should be thoroughly revised 
      and updated. In this backdrop, the first Islamic Educational World 
      Conference was held in Makkah in 1977 in which more than 300 academicians, 
      scholars and intellectuals participated. The first Conference made certain 
      significant recommendations for the Islamization of Knowledge. Later more 
      such Conferences were held in other parts of the world in which Ulama, 
      academicians, scholars and intellectuals of various countries joined. Such 
      Conferences were held, among other countries, in Pakistan, Indonesia and 
      Bangladesh. This writer had the opportunity to take part in the Conference 
      held in Dhaka in 1980. These Conferences helped to a great extent in 
      crystallizing and conceptualizing what should be the future shape and 
      structure of the Islamic Education. Later notable institutions like 
      International Institute of Islamic Thought (IIIT), USA joined in this 
      Movement. The prime focus of activities of IIIT since then had been on the 
      Restructuring of Thought and Islamization of Knowledge including 
      Islamization of Education.<br>
      <br>
      As the outcome of the painstaking efforts of the learned scholars of 
      various disciplines to formulate a pragmatic Islamic Education Policy 
      through the Islamic Education Conferences and contribution of eminent 
      Islamic organizations and individuals, the first Islamic University, the 
      International Islamic University (IIU), Malaysia, was established. 
      Distinguished Islamic scholars of the world, well known for their 
      contribution in relevant fields, who are at the same time specialist in 
      their own discipline and subject and at the same time firm believer in 
      Islam assembled in the new alma mater. Many of these scholars were leaders 
      of the Islamic Movement in their own countries and were at the forefront 
      of dawah, Islamic activities in their own arena. Dr. AbdulHamid 
      AbuSulayman, renowned scholar and current Chairman of IIIT USA took the 
      responsibility of the IIU; Malaysia after initial work has been done by 
      the 1st Rector of the University Prof. Dr. A. Rauf along with his 
      colleagues. A prolific writer, Dr. AbulHamid has in his credit a number of 
      publications of which ‘Towards an Islamic Theory of International 
      Relations’ and ‘Crisis in the Muslim Mind’ are widely acclaimed. Dr. 
      AbulHamid, on assuming the responsibility of the University, vigorously 
      started the work of Islamization of Education. Arabic and Fiqh, Islamic 
      Law and Jurisprudence were introduced as compulsory university requirement 
      courses. The University from the very beginning took steps to gradually 
      Islamize the subjects of the social science discipline and the effort is 
      still on. <br>
      <br>
      Later more Islamic universities have been established in other parts of 
      the world following the model of IIU, Malaysia. One such university has 
      been established in Islamabad (Pakistan), another in Uganda in Africa and 
      another in Kushtia (Bangladesh). It must be admitted that the Islamic 
      University, Bangladesh has, to some extent, lost direction because of 
      political environment within the country, and the University could not 
      make much headway following the model of IIU, Malaysia; nevertheless it 
      has to be accepted that Islamic University, Bangladesh also made some 
      contribution in the Islamization of Education and Islamization of 
      Knowledge. Later Darul Ihsan University and Islamic University, Chittagong 
      were established with the same mission&#61482;.<br>
      <br>
      To many it remains a question why Islamization of Education is important 
      and this demands an in-depth examination and critical and careful 
      analysis. Islamization of Education is significant because the root cause 
      of all problems and malaises of the Ummah, the Muslim community, is 
      education. If we look at the setback and crisis of the Ummah, if we 
      evaluate the political, economic and social dilemma of the Muslim world 
      and particularly if we refer to the overall scenario prevailing in the 
      Muslim countries from the Islamic point of view and look at them from an 
      Islamic vision and perspective then we shall reach to the conclusion that 
      the ultimate reason for all these ills in the Muslim world lies in our 
      failure to restructure the education which shall not only meet the demand 
      of our time but at the same time make a Muslim a Muslim. Had we been able 
      to educate Muslims, as worthy Muslims there would not have been political, 
      economic and social problems in the Muslim world of the size and level as 
      exist now. Such prominent scholars and academicians as Ismail Raji al 
      Faruqi, AbdulHamid AbuSulayman and Syed Ali Ashraf, eminent educationist, 
      Islamic scholar and founder of Darul Ihsan University Bangladesh share 
      this view.<br>
      <br>
      Islamic educationists and scholars are of unanimous opinion that the root 
      cause of all problems of the Ummah is education, it is more appropriately 
      the crisis of education. Such thinkers and intellectuals identify the 
      failure of the education as being the prime reason of the crisis faced by 
      the world today. They think that education has failed to achieve the 
      desired objective because our education has ignored ethics and morality 
      during the last one hundred years.<br>
      <br>
      The crisis humankind, the world civilization is facing is because the 
      curriculum of the educational institutions have ignored ethics and 
      morality for at least last one hundred years. As an outcome of this 
      disrespect to eternal moral values, our educational institutions have 
      produced violent and cruel man devoid of love, affection, fraternity, 
      brotherhood and fellow feeling. What has happened in Bosnia, Kosava, 
      Chechnya, Iraq, Kashmir, Afghanistan and more recently in Gujrat in India 
      is the result of modern education, which has produced cruel and violent 
      man. Modern man is not imbibed with the eternal humane values and 
      therefore most sophisticated nations do not mind to bomb unarmed civilian, 
      women and children in Afghanistan and does not mind to continue sanction 
      against Iraq at the costs the lives of millions of Iraqi children. Nobody 
      can hope to change this sorry state of affairs, to really improve the face 
      of modern civilization unless the educational curriculum is restructured 
      and emphasis is given on moral and ethical values.<br>
      <br>
      What is, therefore, required is to reorganize the education on the 
      foundation of ethical principles, to combine moral education with 
      professional education. Professional excellence has to be integrated with 
      morality and ethics, which basically can be derived from religion. As far 
      as Muslims are concerned such values can be drawn from Islam and if Muslim 
      societies are not rectified in the light of the precept and teachings of 
      Islam then the Muslim societies nay the whole world is bound to suffer. 
      That means humankind will suffer. The solution, therefore, lies in 
      combining Islamic values with modern subjects in case of Muslims. Where 
      non-Muslims are in majority as in Japan, China and other countries modern 
      subject should be combined with ethics and morality. Nobody should forget 
      that in the days of globalization and internet in the new millennium no 
      region remains unaffected if any part of it is affected. Therefore the 
      problem has to be addressed both at regional and international levels.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. AbdulHamid A. AbuSulayman, former Rector IIU, Malaysia and currently 
      Chairman of IIIT USA addressing a seminar in Dhaka during his recent visit 
      to Bangladesh pointed out: “Muslims are not performing. Bangladesh is not 
      performing. The Muslim world is not performing”. He pointed out that in 
      January 2001 (or December 2000) the total GDP of the Muslim world was US $ 
      1100 billion whereas the GDP of Japan at that time was US $ 5500 billion, 
      five times more than Muslim world whereas Muslim world is spread over from 
      Pacific to Atlantic. Why this is the condition of the Muslim world, Dr. 
      AbdulHamid asked? “Why are not Muslims performing, why are not Muslims 
      motivated, why are not Muslims big actors in the world scene, why are they 
      only spectators, why they are in the fringe”, Dr. AbdulHamid asked his 
      learned audience in the seminar. <br>
      <br>
      Dr. AbdulHamid thinks that Muslims are marginalized because: “We are not 
      motivated”. The present educational system has failed to motivate Muslims 
      and one of the foremost reasons of this is that Muslims still have slavish 
      mentality of the colonial period. We could not leave, get rid of slavish 
      mentality. We only imitate. We do not think positively and in a 
      constructive way. We have lost our originality and creativity. Dr. 
      AbdulHamid thinks that we must give due importance education deserves and 
      integrate moral values and ethics with modern professional knowledge. He 
      believes that we as Muslims should integrate professional education and 
      social science with Islamic values.<br>
      <br>
      Now if we look back to history what we see. If we look back to Abbasi, 
      Usmania or Mughul period we will find that their educational system did 
      produce army generals or civil servants who studied the then modern 
      subjects and at the same were fully conversant with teachings of the Quran, 
      Sunnah, the Tradition of the Prophet (SAWS), Fiqh, Islamic law and 
      jurisprudence. <br>
      <br>
      There was integration in the educational systems of them. An army officer 
      during the Abbasi used to know not only military science but also such an 
      officer was conversant with the teachings of Quran, Sunnah, Fiqh and 
      Arabic language. Likewise a civil servant was required to study the then 
      professional subjects along with Quran, Sunnah, Fiqh and Arabic. 
      Approximately 150 to 200 years earlier, the system of education was an 
      integrated whole. <br>
      <br>
      What is then the responsibility of the new generation of Muslims? The duty 
      and obligation of the Muslims, the task of the entire humankind is to 
      think and reflect on how to restructure the educational system and not to 
      give over emphasis only on professional knowledge for if we only over 
      emphasize on professional knowledge then we shall only produce robot and 
      not man with soul and values. In fact we have to structure educational 
      system in such a way, for all nations in all countries worldwide, which 
      shall integrate professional knowledge with ethics and morality and we 
      Muslims believe it and are fully committed to it. This can be done on the 
      basis of religion. It should however be made clear that the establishment 
      of Islamic University does not mean that the door of such educational 
      institutions shall remain closed for the non-Muslims. Islamic University 
      is open for all. Any student can study in such a university and the 
      teachings of Islam shall not be imposed on the non-Muslim student. 
      Non-Muslim student shall have to study only the educational program 
      (including the University requirement courses). It needs to be further 
      examined whether non-Muslim student can be offered optional subjects in 
      some discipline or areas. <br>
      <br>
      The message of Islam is universal. Islam addresses humankind: Ya Ayyuhan 
      nass, O mankind. Allah has revealed Quran not to divide mankind. The duty 
      of the Prophet (SAWS), was to unite people. Islam teaches man not to take 
      away the rights of others but to protect it. Islam stands for moderation. 
      In real sense there is no extremism in Islam. Islam is a middle way. Allah 
      (SWT) in Surat Al Baqarah has revealed: “We have created you as a balanced 
      community”(2:143). Allah did not tell that We created you as extreme 
      community.<br>
      <br>
      It is, therefore, clear that if we are fully able to appreciate and 
      realize the true meaning of Islam, then we cannot turn out to be 
      extremist. There is no reason of non-Muslim being afraid of Islam. If we 
      look back to history then we shall find that Prophet Muhammad (SAWS) 
      established a system in which life, honor and property of the non-Muslims 
      were fully secured. Moreover, in the commonwealth established by the 
      Prophet (SAWS) under the Charter of Medina the Jews were self governing 
      and autonomous and they used to conduct the life according to their own 
      laws. The Muslims used to follow their own law. The state was run 
      according to Islamic Shariah and all the communities participated in the 
      joint activities of the state such as defense. <br>
      <br>
      The essence of Islam is Tawheed, which not only means that Allah is one 
      but also it signifies that humankind is one and its honor is inviolable. 
      The objective of the Shariah is welfare of the mankind. Tawheed signifies 
      the welfare of the entire mankind. It also means and implies that 
      believers of Tawheed must always wish, and long for well-being and 
      happiness of others and must not distinguish between man and man and 
      respect all man. There may be small difference between man and man for 
      various reasons but it is not good to differentiate between man and man. 
      It is against the principle of Tawheed. Prophet Muhammad (SAWS) fully 
      absorbed the full meaning of Tawheed. He (SAWS) said in his farewell 
      pilgrimage speech: No Arab has superiority over non-Arab. White colored 
      has no superiority over the black. What is the meaning of this? There is 
      male and female both in white skinned and black skinned people. It 
      signifies that female of a particular race is not superior to male of 
      another race nor male of a particular race is superior to another. 
      Likewise what is the meaning of Arabs and non-Arabs are equal. It means 
      Arab female is to equal to non-Arab male and non-Arab male is equal to 
      Arab female.<br>
      <br>
      Small differences do not change the basic equality of humanity. All human 
      beings remain basically equal in honour, respect and dignity, despite 
      differences in duties and responsibilities. The differences that exist in 
      our society are the result of the prevalent educational system. There is 
      nothing to fear from Islamic education. If Islamic educational system is 
      established in Bangladesh the door of education shall remain wide open for 
      all. There shall be various options open for the non-Muslims to prosecute 
      their studies. New avenues shall be opened and new scopes and 
      opportunities shall be created. Human equality shall be pursued 
      meticulously. The honor, dignity and respect of the non-Muslims shall be 
      vigorously guarded. There shall be no compulsion in respect of religion as 
      enunciated in the Quran: La Ikraha Fiddeen (Surat Al Baqarah: 256).</td>
