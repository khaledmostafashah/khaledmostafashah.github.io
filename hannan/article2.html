      <span style="font-size:12.0pt">The history of the beauty contest is not 
      clearly known to me. Who, where and when it started is unknown, but the 
      common belief is that the beauty contest started some 60-70 years back in 
      the West. Later some elements started to organize such beauty contests in 
      the East, particularly in India and Japan. Of the total 60 Muslim 
      countries, a few hold such contests against the age-old culture, custom, 
      tradition and value system. In some countries the government is 
      patronizing such beauty contests and in others individuals and private 
      organizations arrange such contests. Never such contests were ever 
      organized in Bangladesh. Strangely, some people are now trying to organize 
      such beauty contests against the deep-rooted faith, ethics and norms of 
      the majority people of our country. The government of Bangladesh did not 
      allow organizing such functions in the country and therefore the people 
      who are active to raze the basic elements of the culture of Bangladesh, a 
      predominantly Muslim country, in the name of globalization and modernism, 
      organized a beauty contest in London some time back and selected a girl 
      who later participated in the world contest. Of late, some people are 
      organizing beauty contest in Bangladesh in the name and cover of fashion 
      show. </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify">
      <span style="font-size:12.0pt">The most pertinent question is: does beauty 
      contest enhance the prestige and dignity of the womenfolk of our country 
      or is it in any way related with the development of the country’s economy? 
      In the beauty contest, the participating women are scantily dressed, are 
      mostly required to expose their body and beauty before the male judges 
      walking in the most offensive and distasteful manner. Does it in any way 
      increase respect of the women? In fact, the uncovered body of woman brings 
      disgrace for her. Historically all noble ladies even in the West until now 
      were dressed in the most dignified manner. In fact such half clothed women 
      become an object of commercial display and turn into the easy prey of the 
      lust of the males.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align:justify">
      <span style="font-size:12.0pt">The question is: why beauty contest of the 
      woman is being organized when no beauty contest is planned to select the 
      most beautiful man? In fact a section of business community organizes 
      beauty contest of the women to use them for commercial purposes for which 
      women, our sisters and mothers, are disgraced. The beauty contests excite 
      male members of the society. This is true not only in the matter of beauty 
      contest, any obscene, offensive and vulgar programme involving women is 
      bound to incite male members. Such programmes are responsible for the 
      moral degeneration of our youth. The root cause of the increase of the 
      rape, violence and crime related to women are the spread of obscenity in 
      the society. The beauty contest therefore in no way increase prestige, 
      honour, dignity, safety and security of the women rather women lose 
      respect, and their security is further endangered. </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align:justify">
      <span style="font-size:12.0pt">Does the beauty contest in any way 
      contribute to the economic development? No empirical study or survey has 
      ever established that beauty contest some way or other has played any 
      constructive&nbsp; or significant role for the progress and development of any 
      country. There is no logic behind the claim of some persons that such 
      beauty contest directly or indirectly contribute in the economic stride 
      and progress of any society. Beauty contest has in no meaningful way made 
      any contribution in the increase of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) or the 
      national income. Some good-looking women who won in the beauty contest 
      later joined the advertisement industry as model. This might some way 
      financially benefit them personally. The joining of some pretty women in 
      the commercial and advertisement industry might have increased the demand 
      of certain product, soap, paste etc in the market but this increase takes 
      place mostly at the expense or reduction of sale of some other soaps, 
      paste etc of other companies. This however does not as a whole increase 
      the GDP. Moreover products are sold because of the quality, not because of 
      the fair looking models or due to their physical posture. Some tourists of 
      foreign countries might come to visit a particular country for a day or 
      two, but this is very insignificant and does not carry any weight or 
      credence. Such beauty contest, for sure, has no value in terms of the 
      economic activity of a country or benefit the tourist industry on a long 
      term basis.. </span></p>

      <span style="font-size:12.0pt">What is the reaction of the women 
      concerning the beauty contest? In this regard let us see the article by 
      Hasina Habib, a student of BUET who in an article published in the daily 
      Inqilab on 2<sup>nd</sup> April 2002 captioned ‘Beauty Contest Vis A Vis 
      Art’&nbsp; writes:</span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align:justify">
      <span style="font-size:12.0pt">“BTV broadcasted a programme of beauty 
      contest on 3<sup>rd</sup> April. The commentator during the presentation 
      ceremony of the programme on several occasions commented that these 
      beautiful ladies are the assets of the country. On what consideration 
      these pretty ladies are the assets of the country? Earning forex by 
      showing and screening beauty cannot be a prestigious profession or an 
      aesthetic art. On what reckoning then the participants of beauty contest 
      can be asset, when such contest in itself is not honourable? The questions 
      that were put forward to the participants of the contest to ascertain the 
      intelligence and the capacity for immediate response to quarry were not at 
      all scholarly. Such questions were asked: To grow up is not an interesting 
      matter, what do you think? What do you mean by hairstyle? … etc. How such 
      hollow and meaningless questions can be the reflection of intelligence and 
      wisdom?&nbsp; The ultimate objective of the clothing is to cover up the body. 
      Its aim is also to protect prestige, honour and the dignity of the 
      individual personality. But in the presentation ceremony of the beauty 
      contest as broadcast by the BTV the participant women were shown walking 
      in such skin tight, bare and half naked way as if the purpose is to 
      attract male members who are viewing. Such exposure of the body and beauty 
      of the women is nothing but the wild expression of nakedness and offensive 
      and indeed distasteful matter.&nbsp; Most of the guests present in the beauty 
      contest had been male and their expression was objectionable, unpleasant 
      and obnoxious. The only exception was Endrew Kishore who was seen looking 
      down bowing head by keeping his palm on the forehead.&nbsp; Rest of the males 
      were looking and observing this nude art (!) with their lustful eyes.&nbsp; 
      Does the definition of art or aesthetic beauty has changed into nudity and 
      obscenity in the so-called modern life? How the exposure of the body of 
      the women can be a sign of progress of the civilization? Why should we 
      copy the negative and obscene elements of another culture leaving their 
      positive elements? If nudity is considered a sign of progress then women 
      one day will require becoming totally naked to increase the reserve of 
      foreign exchange. In other words the loathsome and abhorrent male members 
      will not spend money unless women expose them by becoming totally naked to 
      earn money. It seems that in near future all people will become naked like 
      the animal of jungles to keep pace with the development.&nbsp; </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align:justify">
      <span style="font-size:12.0pt">Those who do not have the sense of 
      self-esteem and dignity and do not mind in becoming naked in front of the 
      male jury and their only objective is to earn money by exposing their body 
      and beauty, what name we can give to the profession of such people?”</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">Hasina 
      Habib rightly pointed out that beauty contest which lacks socio-economic, 
      moral and ethical consideration cannot be an art in the esthetic sense or 
      an asset for the majority of the people of Bangladesh who are believers of 
      Islamic ideology and values. Needless to mention that the so-called beauty 
      contest, which is against the ideology of Islam and its teachings, is also 
      against the history, tradition and culture of Bangladesh. It is not in 
      agreement with the values of other religious faiths. We therefore appeal 
      to all the businessmen, industrialists and cultural organizers of our 
      country to take immediate and effective steps to stop the recurrence of 
      further beauty contests. Not only beauty contests, we also appeal to 
      business magnets, industrialists and socio-cultural workers to ensure that 
      nothing is done in the name of cultural activities which cause moral 
      decadence and disgrace and humiliate women, our daughters, sisters and 
      mothers. Our message to the organizers, leaders and members of the women 
      right groups is that you be active to wipe out the root cause of violence 
      from the society and the moral degeneration of our youth and events that 
      are not the demonstration of the uplift of women in the society rather are 
      the causes of shame and ignominy for the women. We also appeal to the 
      government to keep watch so that some people working against our culture 
      and value system cannot organize beauty contest in the cover and garb of 
      fashion show or any other name. We all must do everything possible at our 
      command before it exceeds all limits and before it is too late.</span></td>
